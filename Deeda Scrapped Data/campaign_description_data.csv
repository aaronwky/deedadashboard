But not for Safri Bin Salleh, 43.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">He used to be an avid weightlifter who was also actively involved in contact sports like soccer, rock-climbing, skydiving and touch rugby.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">His active life came crashing down after two falls, and a diagnosis of bone marrow cancer.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"">The Turning Point</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">In April 2013, Safri dozed off after returning from his night shift. When his wife woke him up, he couldn’t move and was paralysed from below his neck.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">He was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma Cancer Stage 3 (Bone marrow cancer).</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">“All my organs gave way. I had liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), heart ameroid, diabetes, high blood pressure, acute kidney injury, and chronic gout where my joints were inflamed and swollen, and the pain was excruciating. I had to go for dialysis and was bedridden. My doctor said if I did not go for any treatment, I only had six months to live,” he explained.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Yet, he did not let thoughts of fear or worry seep through his mind.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">“My wife was worried. But I told her not to worry as I will seek treatment. I was determined to get better,” said Safri.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Since then, his wife has been his full-time caregiver. His family relies on various financial assistance schemes from various organisations.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"">Focusing on His Diet</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Safri’s cancer was a jolt out of the blue. It reminded him that he has to take care of himself before he can take care of his family. He decided to put in more effort in ensuring that he and his family have a balanced and healthy diet.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">“While I did not care for my body previously and instead abused it through the supplements I took, I decided to take better care of my health. While I did not care about what I ate before, now I take better care of my diet.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">The monthly FoodAid worth $250 from the Singapore Red Cross benefit me and my family a lot because it enables us to have fresh food products, and my children can grow up healthily,” he explained.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Safri hopes his life story will inspire others facing challenging times.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">“Everyone has problems. It is important to have a positive attitude. I see problems as challenges. Whenever there is a problem, there is always a solution. No matter how big your problem is, face the problem.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">I faced my problems one at a time; be it for my debt, or my medical condition. You can’t solve all the problems yourself. Ask for help.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">The world is not a bad place, good people come to help. Just as Red Cross did,” affirmed Safri.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Many of our FoodAid recipients are like Safri.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p><strong class=""ql-size-large"">How You Can Help, and What Your Gift Will Do</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">With your gift, you can help people like Safri and his children get rid of food worries, and they’ll be able to buy and enjoy healthier food as a beneficiary of FoodAid.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">If you divided the $250 worth of food vouchers that feeds a family of four each month, it means less than $9/day for their meals… Probably lower than the cost of a large-sized cup of premium coffee that many of us enjoy regularly.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">While you don’t have to give up the little treats in life, you’ll likely find it more enjoyable and satisfying to gift a mere $3/day to families like Safri’s.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">If you can encourage 2 or 3 of your friends to join you in monthly gifting together, then it means a family of four will not have food worries for each month that they receive your support.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">I’d like to ask you for your help with giving the gift of FoodAid to such families.

Singapore Red Cross Society,Sustainable Kids Market 2024 by Peace of Art,"<p>Amidst Singapore's towering skyline lies a concealed reality — 23,900 children live in public rental housing, grappling with the adversities of cramped living conditions and severely restricted opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p>The <strong>Sustainable Kids Market 2024</strong>, taking place on <strong>May 25-26</strong> at <strong>Marina Square</strong>, emerges as a groundbreaking catalyst for change — a first-of-its-kind community event committed to ensuring academic and mentorship support for children in public rental housing. The mission is clear: equip every child and member of the future generation with essential tools, despite circumstance or background.</p><p><br></p><p>At the heart of this movement is the impactful <strong>KIDSforKIDS</strong> initiative, uniting children across the nation to empower their less fortunate peers through the transformative power of art. A child-centric theme, focused on <strong><em>The Art of Sustainable Living</em></strong>, weaves through various aspects of the Sustainable Kids Market, encompassing an art auction, public art collaboration, sustainable living workshops, and live performances.</p><p><br></p><p>This unique event transforms every citizen into an advocate for Sustainable Living, and as well as a fundraiser for the underprivileged, exemplifying the <strong>democratisation of philanthropy</strong>, where <strong>even the youngest individual becomes a giver and change-maker</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Your invaluable support will breathe life into the Young Hearts programme, delivering educational support, enrichment, and mentorship to empower these children, to break the intergenerational chains of vulnerability that entrap them. Together, let us confront the challenges faced by underprivileged children in our nation, charting a course toward a sustainable and inclusive future for Singapore.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>BENEFICIARY</u></strong></p><p>Our objective for the Sustainable Kids Market 2024 is to raise <strong>$100,000</strong> in funding to facilitate the expansion of the <strong>Young Hearts</strong> programme by the <strong>Singapore Red Cross (Institute of Public Character)</strong>, to support a greater number of underprivileged children with education and mentorship, as well as to provide them with opportunities that will be otherwise out of reach.</p><p><br></p><p>The program includes:</p><p>● Education for children between four to 18 years old to enhance literacy and confidence.</p><p>● Mentorship to enrich their development through a positive and holistic approach adopted by volunteers who serve as positive role models to provide the children with guidance, mentorship and motivation.</p><p>● Enrichment through targeted programmes and personal development workshops with partners to nurture the students by equipping them with character development opportunities, skills and abilities.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>ORGANISER</u></strong></p><p>Peace of Art is a unique not-for-profit organisation with the mission to embed The Art of Sustainable Living into the cultural fabric of our nation, and bolster the support for underprivileged children to foster a Sustainable Future for Singapore, through community engagement and corporate involvement.</p><p><br></p><p>Distinguishing itself from other philanthropic fundraisers, Peace of Art maintains a <strong>100% Impact policy</strong> — <strong>we give 100% of what we raise</strong> — ensuring every donation received will reach the underprivileged individuals we serve.

SRC welcomes the seed money which will be contributed by the Singapore Government towards this public appeal.</p><p><br></p><p>Mr Benjamin William, Secretary General / CEO, Singapore Red Cross, said, “Together with the International Red Cross Movement, we have been closely monitoring the situation since the onset of the crisis. We expect the outbreak to continue to spread in China and geographically with the number of new cases rising in the next days and weeks. Our planned response at this point is focused on assisting the communities worst affected in China. Our response plan will be adjusted based on ongoing developments and assessments. We look forward to working with organisations to support the relief efforts.”</p><p><br></p><p>Later today, a two-man team from Singapore Red Cross (SRC) will be going to the Asia Pacific Office of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which is coordinating the Red Cross Movement response to the coronavirus outbreak, to discuss broad strategies and the areas of possible SRC support. Another person will be deployed to the IFRC Office in Kuala Lumpur, for the next few weeks, to support the response efforts of the Movement.</p><p><br></p><p>Additionally, SRC will deploy one person to Beijing, China to work directly with the Movement response team there. This will include the needs assessment of affected communities, as well as, strategising the response to meet these needs.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile in Singapore, the SRC has been engaging communities, online and offline, to promote behaviours that reduce the risk of contracting or transmitting the virus, and to facilitate community understanding and acceptance of infection prevention and control measures. SRC volunteers are providing advice to beneficiaries, especially vulnerable elderly persons, to help to prevent misinformation, rumours and panic. SRC has also posted informative prevention messages on social media.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Additional information:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Singapore Red Cross will be the one handling the funds.</p><p><br></p><p>The funds will be distributed in collaboration with the International&nbsp;Federation of Red Cross, with whom we are coordinating our response.

I am 67 years old, and for the past four decades, I've been battling an auto-immune disease that has significantly adversely impacted my life.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(60, 64, 72);"">Besides having a coma, I had undergone two surgeries. These surgeries, unfortunately, led to complications that brought about blood clots in my legs, which impaired my mobility. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(60, 64, 72);"">Heading out for my medical appointments became a dreaded task that triggered much fear, apprehension, and uncertainty. I would painstakingly manoeuvre myself on a wheelchair out of my home, and flag a taxi to get to my medical appointments. Often, the taxis would speed by without stopping. In the rare instances where the taxi driver kindly gave me a ride, the rides were costly. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(60, 64, 72);"">I was subsequently introduced to the Singapore Red Cross’ (SRC) Medical Chaperone and TransportAid service. It was akin to a ray of hope shining in my life. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(60, 64, 72);"">Since then, a medical chaperone from SRC would fetch me to and from my regular medical appointments at the hospital via the TransportAid vehicle. Occasionally, they would go above and beyond their call of duty by helping me with daily tasks such as packing lunch for me. I am thankful to SRC’s medical chaperones for their cherished friendship and presence in my life, which has given me the peace of mind and enabled me to get to my medical appointments with ease. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(60, 64, 72);"">With love,</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(60, 64, 72);"">Suba</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(60, 64, 72);"">All funds raised through this campaign will be under Be Our Champion for Humanity</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(60, 64, 72);"">--</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(60, 64, 72);"">As the year draws to a close, we hope you will consider making a monthly donation while joining us as a Champion of the Singapore Red Cross.

All funds raised will be channeled towards the relief and recovery of affected communities, with a focus on mobile medical camps, emergency healthcare and medical equipment for the most remote areas.</p><p><br></p><p>Intervention activities conducted by the ARCS includes livelihood restoration and protection such as community-based income generation activities, training in entrepreneurship, and seed capital for project start-up. Many of these activities will prioritise women and female-led households, in particular those who have been widowed by the conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>In the area of Health, ARCS will be organising community-based hygiene promotion activities with a focus on education to inspire and empower community members to improve their hygiene knowledge and practices. Other activities that this appeal will support include mobile medical camps, which provide primary healthcare services to the most remote areas.</p><p><br></p><p>Since October 2020, Afghanistan has been experiencing severe droughts due to below-normal rainfall as a result of a La Niña phenomenon. These conditions are expected to continue through the first half of 2021. The situation is further exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic and other complications already faced in Afghanistan, such as food insecurity, conflict, and high prices of basic commodities. These issues continue to disproportionately affect women and children.</p><p><br></p><p>In affected provinces, the drought has affected the provision of health care services due to stretched capacities as emergency health and water needs rise in affected areas. The drought has also affected people's income and livelihood, resulting in increased food insecurity.</p><p><br></p><p>Notes:</p><p><strong>Donations to overseas efforts are not tax-deductible.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In the event that donations exceed the expenses incurred by Singapore Red Cross in this specific disaster response, any surplus or unspent money, after 3 years from the date of inception of the fund, can be used to prepare for and serve communities affected by other disasters or may be used to complement or to sustain projects undertaken by SRC in helping the vulnerable in areas affected by disasters.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>About Singapore Red Cross</strong></p><p>Singapore Red Cross is a homegrown humanitarian organisation, dedicated to relieving human suffering, protecting lives and dignity, and responding to emergencies since 1949.

National Arthritis Foundation,Arthritis Hurts - You can help soothe the pain (NAF Mail Donation Appeal),"<p>As early as Primary 2, Esther struggled to walk the short distance to school. Her mother felt something was amiss and brought her to the hospital for checks. Even though initial test results came back normal, she would often wake up in pain in the middle of the night. At school, she had to change her CCA three times – from skipping, to choir, to art – when regular activities became difficult to accomplish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Persistent in finding out what was ailing her daughter, Esther's mother pursued in seeking a diagnosis. Esther was in Primary 5 when she was finally diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis(JIA), a lifelong and incurable condition that causes pain and stiffness in the spine. It can eventually lead to a total fusion of the spine and may result in a hunched posture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Esther relies on medication administered via an injector pen every two weeks to help with her condition, although there is to date no permanent cure for JIA. The regular injections have kept her pain-free although the arthritis may be triggered whenever she is stressed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her family worries about the cost of treatment, which is long-term. Medication for arthritis patients can cost as much as $30,000 a year and many require continuous treatment to manage their ailment.&nbsp;NAF helps patients like Esther with her medical costs so that she has a chance of living a normal childhood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your donation will change someone's life.</p>"

Animal Lovers League,"Help John, Little John, Amber & other rescued animals","<p>Animal Lovers League is a no-kill shelter in Singapore. It cares for about 500 rescued cats and dogs who were once injured, abandoned, abused and traumatised pets or strays.</p><p><br></p><p>As a no-kill shelter that values life and explores every visage of hope for all its rescues regardless of their age, injury or condition, veterinary bills are one of its constant struggles. Some of the rescues in its care require regular and lifelong medical care, while others may require immediate lifesaving treatment. Here are some stories of the rescues under ALL's charge.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Samantha</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Our dear Samantha (endearingly known to many as Sam) is a lovely Singapore Special. All this time, she has been a rambunctious and healthy dog. She's a cat-loving dog and spent most of her time hanging out with the cats in ALL's cattery. In 2021, her health started to take a turn. She started losing weight and was later determined to have kidney disease.</p><p><br></p><p>On top of vet services like tests, procedures and hospitalisation she has required the past months, maintaining regular medical needs that keep Samantha healthy and well can come up to at least $500 a month. Her routine includes 1000ml Hartmann's subcutaneous drips, supplements for his kidney health, vet visits to check her condition and a special diet specific for optimising kidney health.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>John and Little John</strong></p><p><br></p><p>John and Little John are siblings who were rescued together. Being stray dogs from birth, they are very skittish and remain wary of people. Recently, both brothers developed a very bad cough that quickly led to pneumonia. They require round the clock medical attention to ensure they receive sufficient oxygen and IV fluids.</p><p><br></p><p>Emergency medical cases like these can arise at any time, and ALL is always on alert to ensure animals in need get the medical attention they need at the drop of a pin.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Amber</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Amber is a regular blood donor who has saved lives of other cats in dire need. This loving, calm and gentle ginger cat makes visits to the vet very pleasant. All vets who have met him have share the same story — Amber is so calm, he doesn’t require any sedation when donating blood. To make Amber even more amazing, he LOVES dogs! And dogs love him right back.</p><p><br></p><p>Recently, Amber was diagnosed with kidney insufficiency and had to be brought to the vet for immediate care. His temperature was very low, but our fighter continues to fight and push ahead. We pray that Amber’s renal issues are acute and can be corrected. Amber is one of many cats (both stray and pets) who suffer from kidney problems. He will require a prescribed long-term renal diet and possible subcutaneous fluids to keep him healthy, hopefully for a long time to come. Prescription cat diets that a number of ALL’s cats require can cost up to $500 each month, not including veterinary check ups that help check if the diets are working.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Midnight</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Our dear Midnight was brought to the vet when he started losing weight. During his first vet visit, he was found to be FIV positive -- which explained why his mouth is always uncomfortable and why he is always drooling. He was also dehydrated and severely anaemic. Vets prescribed antibiotics and an injection to ease the pain in his mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>During his latest review, tests revealed his anaemia had not improved and his blood count remained low -- which explained his uneasiness, the constant&nbsp;drooling and foaming. On top of this, his kidneys are not doing well and he requires a special kidney diet and daily subcutaneous fluids to keep him well.</p><p><br></p><p>These are some of the rescued animals in our care. While we push on to continue rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming our charges, your donations make a big difference in saving lives too. Please donate to their care and help us continue to help them. Thank you and God Bless.</p><p><br></p><p>#ALLThatMatters</p>"

To further support her needs, we also provide financial aid through our financial assistance scheme to cover her training fees and insurance, and also provide transport and meal allowances.</p><p><br></p><p>Germaine’s mother has also noticed the significant improvements in her daughter.

Society for WINGS,"Embracing Life Transitions, Rising above the Challenges","<p>Women hold up half the sky as the saying goes. This is so true as many continue to carry the burden of caregiving even as they age. And yet women are more vulnerable than men as they live longer by an average of 4 years, often beset with physical ailments, face social isolation and financial insecurities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>WINGS support women by building an eco-system of empowering women age 40 and above with knowledge and life skills to age well. They are then provided with a platform to provide peer support through special interest groups and volunteer activities that help others embrace life transitions and rise above challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>WINGS Women-on-the-go, are women who intentionally support others in the community. One example is our Legacy of Love project, where WINGS Senior Digital Ambassadors apply their digital knowledge by helping other women, residents of homes and hospices leave lasting memories for future generations through the production of personal legacy videos.&nbsp;Another soon to be launched project, Bucket of Love will see WINGS Sewing Bees volunteers sew bucket hats for the 1,000 plus women stricken with cancer yearly. These hats help uplift their spirit and keep the dignity of women as they undergo the painful and unpleasant chemotherapy treatment. Our Joyful Singers bring cheer to residents in Homes whilst our balloon sculptors help seniors work their joints by improving mobility and dexterity through the art of sculpting balloons.</p>"

Free Food For All Limited,Ramadan - A Lesson in Compassion,"<p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">About this Campaign</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Ramadan is a very important time of the year for Muslims. It falls on the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, and is probably the most religiously significant time of year for Muslims all over the world.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">During Ramadan, Muslims fast, pray, and reflect. During this month-long period, they refrain from eating any food or drinking any liquids from sunrise to sunset. They also abstain from thoughts and behavior which are considered to be impure under the teachings of Islam. Muslims believe that the spiritual rewards for these good behaviors are magnified during Ramadan. This mental and physical abstinence is truly a test of endurance, willpower, and discipline.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><img src=""/deeda/images/ramadan_lesson/1.png""></span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The act of fasting serves two main purposes. Spiritually and religiously, it helps to remind one of their human, mortal vulnerabilities, as well as their reliance on a higher power for sustenance. Socially, it gives one perspective on how it feels to be hungry and thirsty, so they can feel compassion for the needy and less fortunate in our communities. Whatever religious school of thought you subscribe to, or even for those of amongst us who are atheists, this lesson of compassion and empathy for our fellow human beings is one that we can all surely relate to.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><br></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">This Ramadan, Free Food For All has kickstarted an initiative called </span><strong style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Ramadan RTE Meals 2019</strong><span style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">. FFFA will be raising funds to provide the needy with RTE meals over this period. RTE stands for ""Ready to Eat"", and there's a very practical reason behind this decision. RTE meals have a longer shelf life, and can be delivered in bulk. This reduces unnecessary wastage of food, as well as cuts down on resources that would otherwise be required to deliver fresh food to beneficiaries. These tasty meals are simple to prepare, and are the perfect solution for a quick and easy meal, and can be consumed either for Iftar (sunset meal) or Sahoor (sunrise meal).</span></p><iframe class=""ql-video ql-align-justify"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1uHILdtNWI""></iframe><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">How You Can Help</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Each RTE meal pouch is priced at approximately SGD3.50, and beneficiaries will be delivered a carton of 36 meal pouches.

Free Food For All Limited,Madam Tan saved her granddaughter from child abuse. Will you help them?,"<p>Madam Tan has been a longtime friend of mine since we connected online a few years ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometime last year, she shared with me that her baby granddaughter, Min Min <em>(not her real name),</em> was hospitalized because her father had broken the bones of her little arms. Since she was born, Min Min’s father would beat her whenever he was stressed, leaving her with bruises and red finger marks all over her face and body. Each time, Madam Tan’s daughter, Min Min’s mother, dismissed his actions due to her lack of interest.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://deeda-1254024480.cos.ap-singapore.myqcloud.com/sea-deeda-care/temFoundation/15755446060360-7582714820613752.png""></p><p><br></p><iframe class=""ql-video"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/tuIFlkN0NJ0""></iframe><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Madam Tan had not been living with them, she was unaware that this situation was happening. However, the abuse went too far this time, and the parents had no choice but to bring Min Min to the hospital. This was when Madam Tan was called down after the police were notified of suspected child abuse and saw what had happened. At this point, Madam Tan wanted to take Min Min back where she would be safe, but she was sent back to her parents as the case was still under investigation. As a grandmother, it was her worst nightmare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And then the abuse happened again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""https://deeda-1254024480.cos.ap-singapore.myqcloud.com/sea-deeda-care/294d06b4-87f0-480a-aa6b-b8d8e99c2389/15755460967960-5066472166626652.png""></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This time round, the police granted Min Min child protection, leaving her in the care of Madam Tan.

However, now that she had to take care of Min Min, <strong>she is unable to work and make ends meet.</strong> When I heard of this, I just knew I had to do something.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, Madam Tan told me she needs help with the following expenses:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Gas - $34 per can (40 days)</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">HDB rental $99 per month</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Electricity $150 per month</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Town council&nbsp;$21 per month (owe $270)</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Pigeon Wet tissue x 2 per month</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Cerelac 2 box per week&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Milk powder 1 can per week</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Pampers 1 pack per week</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Rice, fish and meat, potatoes for porridge every day</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In total, this adds up to about <strong>$500/month</strong>. Although the parents sometimes give Madam Tan money, they are not enough and inconsistent. As a result, Madam Tan has had to use her savings and now, they are almost gone. <strong>To get by, she eats maggie noodles and goes to her friend’s stall for dinner so that she can save money for Min Min’s milk powder and pampers.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Through Deeda, I managed to get in touch with Nizar from Free Food for All (FFFA), who kindly sponsored Madam Tan and Min Min with three months’ worth of diapers, milk powder and the food they need for basic living.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=""https://deeda-1254024480.cos.ap-singapore.myqcloud.com/sea-deeda-care/294d06b4-87f0-480a-aa6b-b8d8e99c2389/15755460469510-18925735159252333.jpeg""></p><p><br></p><p>However, they still need help with their <strong>outstanding Gas, Electricity, Town Council and Rental expenses</strong>.

The closest available car park was at a HDB in Bukit Panjang, more than 1km away. From there, we hiked into the forest.

However, we realised that the task ahead was not going to be easy. None of our usual trapping methods would work in the heavily wooded environment, and she was wary of our presence. She barked at us and kept her distance while we fed and played with her puppies. At one point, she even bolted when one of our volunteers stretched out his hand towards her. While we were there, we also found 2 other adults dogs living in the area, though similarly as wary.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 30, 33); background-color: transparent;"">We stayed for a total of 2 hours exploring the surroundings and brainstorming the best approach to trap them. During this time, we noticed empty food and water containers strewn on the forest bed and surmised that this pack had a regular feeder. In the end, we figured it would be best to locate the feeder whom we hope the dogs trusted enough to approach.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 30, 33); background-color: transparent;"">Another difficulty was getting the dog(s) back to our vehicles at Bukit Panjang. It would be an arduous undertaking to carry several heavy crates over such a distance and on such an undulating terrain. We then decided to contact the National Parks Board (NPark) to seek permission to drive a vehicle in and transport the dogs out once we had trapped them. However, they told us that we had to give them</span><em style=""color: rgb(28, 30, 33); background-color: transparent;""> at least 3 days</em><span style=""color: rgb(28, 30, 33); background-color: transparent;""> advance notice before we could do so.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 30, 33); background-color: transparent;"">In the meantime, we desperately tried to locate the feeder by reaching out to all our contacts. Once again, we got lucky. A feeder from another location had her contact and passed us her number! One of our volunteers, Fanzhe, decided to meet her and ask for her help in executing the plan the next morning.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 30, 33); background-color: transparent;"">It was providence that all 3 dogs appeared when Fanzhe and the feeder went into the forest. As we had suspected, the dogs greeted her familiar face with waggy tails. Getting the injured dog medical treatment was the top priority. As such, Fanzhe decided to seize the opportunity and secured her with the help of the feeder. He also proceeded to gather the pups, as he did not want them to be left behind without their mother.&nbsp;Not wanting to waste any more time waiting for NPark’s approval, Fanzhe placed the heavy crates on a trolley and push them all the way back to the carpark, carefully avoiding rocks and tree roots along the way. Thereafter, he went back up again to secure the other 2 adult dogs for sterilisation and medical check-up.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><span style=""color: rgb(67, 67, 67); background-color: transparent;"">Present Situation</span></h3><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 30, 33); background-color: transparent;"">The injured dog has been affectionately christened Baby by the feeder whom she has been feeding for around 10 years together with the other 2 adults: Laokow (male) and Lucky (female).

Assisi Hospice,Support us as we meet patients’ needs at their end-of-life,"<p>67 year-old Mr Tan* was diagnosed with a rare tumour behind his abdominal area (retroperitoneal liposarcoma), and was admitted to Assisi Hospice in Jun 2023. He had been divorced for over 20 years, and was working as a cleaner and staying in a 1-room rental flat before admission. When he came under our care, he expressed his wish to reconnect with his ex-wife Li Shan* and his only son.</p><p><br></p><p>Our Clinical Pastoral Care staff managed to reach out to Li Shan through their church pastor. As she shared with our social worker Calista about the circumstances she faced leading up to the divorce, she broke down and cried. Mr Tan struggled with gambling and substance abuse, which eventually led to her leaving the marriage in the interest of their child.</p><p><br></p><p>“I came because I want to tell him that I forgive him, “Li Shan shared with Calista. “But I don’t know why I cannot bring myself to go into the room.” Calista listened patiently and offered Li Shan the emotional support she needed. With her company, Li Shan mustered up her courage and went into Mr Tan’s room. When they saw each other, they started to sob. After a long while, he finally mustered up enough strength for the two words, in between sobs - “I’m sorry”. Still in tears, she replied softly, “I forgive you. You can go in peace.”</p><p><br></p><p>After that day, Li Shan continued to visit. Mr Tan deteriorated rapidly, and passed on peacefully in July 2023. Our volunteers from the No One Dies Alone programme supported the family by keeping vigil at Mr Tan’s side during his final moments. In addition to Assisi’s substantial subsidies supported by donations, our social worker also helped to apply for Medifund to pay for his medical bill, and arranged a pro bono funeral for him.</p><p><br></p><p>At Assisi Hospice, our patients come to us not only for medical care. Many times, there are other wounds and needs. Support our work as we strive to meet our patients’ needs at the most vulnerable time in their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>*Names have been changed</p>"

Instead of waiting it out, she trusted her mother's intuition and took him to the pediatrician for a checkup.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(60, 64, 72);"">That decision may have saved Jacob's life.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(60, 64, 72);"">After running some tests, the doctor discovered a large mass in Jacob's abdomen. He was diagnosed with stage 3 neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer. The family's world was shattered.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(60, 64, 72);"">Jacob immediately began an aggressive treatment plan of chemotherapy, radiation, stem cell transplant, and surgery to remove the tumor. The road was long and immensely difficult for such a young child, but his family remained hopeful and positive.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(60, 64, 72);"">Thanks to Sophie's prompt action in getting Jacob checked out at the first signs something was wrong, the cancer was caught relatively early before spreading further.

Besides enhancing our students' mental resilience, the MHP also aims to impart them with first aid skills through workshops and interactive activities. This is so that they can detect mental health symptoms in their peers and timely intervene where appropriate. SYH's continuous work with the schools and youths makes us well-placed to seamlessly implement MHP.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The adolescence period is extremely crucial. For one’s development in their later years. Mental health first aid program aims to assist someone experiencing mental health crises through a series of workshops.</p><p>Achieved through:&nbsp;</p><p>o	A 10-hour educational programme that mixes information sharing, role-playing and simulations to inculcate how to identify mental health issues, provide support with appropriate interventions, and connect with resources.</p><p>o	Role-playing and simulation activities supplement information sharing to normalise what would be potentially uncomfortable situations for participants.</p><p>o	Complemented by self-directed workshops delivered via social media platform that helps participants learn about (a) themselves; (b) their insecurities; (c) their support systems; and (d) their coping mechanisms&nbsp;</p><p>o	To address underlying triggers of mental health issues including (a) competitive culture; (b) stigma; (c) lack of healthy coping mechanisms</p><p>o	Popular figures will be featured to help reduce stigma and raise awareness</p><p><br></p><p>Your generosity today will aid in the implementation of the program and greatly influence the lives of these youths.&nbsp;</p>"
