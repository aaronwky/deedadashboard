Singapore Red Cross Society,You're The Difference Between An Empty Stomach And a Filled One,"“The monthly FoodAid worth $250 from the Singapore Red Cross benefit me and my family a lot because it enables us to have fresh food products, and my children can grow up healthily,” - Safri Bin SallehDear Friend,When life deals you a bad hand, it is easy to plunge into the depths of despair. But not for Safri Bin Salleh, 43.He used to be an avid weightlifter who was also actively involved in contact sports like soccer, rock-climbing, skydiving and touch rugby.His active life came crashing down after two falls, and a diagnosis of bone marrow cancer.The Turning PointIn April 2013, Safri dozed off after returning from his night shift. When his wife woke him up, he couldn’t move and was paralysed from below his neck.He was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma Cancer Stage 3 (Bone marrow cancer).“All my organs gave way. I had liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), heart ameroid, diabetes, high blood pressure, acute kidney injury, and chronic gout where my joints were inflamed and swollen, and the pain was excruciating. I had to go for dialysis and was bedridden. My doctor said if I did not go for any treatment, I only had six months to live,” he explained.Yet, he did not let thoughts of fear or worry seep through his mind.“My wife was worried. But I told her not to worry as I will seek treatment. I was determined to get better,” said Safri.Since then, his wife has been his full-time caregiver. His family relies on various financial assistance schemes from various organisations.Focusing on His DietSafri’s cancer was a jolt out of the blue. It reminded him that he has to take care of himself before he can take care of his family. He decided to put in more effort in ensuring that he and his family have a balanced and healthy diet.“While I did not care for my body previously and instead abused it through the supplements I took, I decided to take better care of my health. While I did not care about what I ate before, now I take better care of my diet.The monthly FoodAid worth $250 from the Singapore Red Cross benefit me and my family a lot because it enables us to have fresh food products, and my children can grow up healthily,” he explained.Safri hopes his life story will inspire others facing challenging times.“Everyone has problems. It is important to have a positive attitude. I see problems as challenges. Whenever there is a problem, there is always a solution. No matter how big your problem is, face the problem.I faced my problems one at a time; be it for my debt, or my medical condition. You can’t solve all the problems yourself. Ask for help.The world is not a bad place, good people come to help. Just as Red Cross did,” affirmed Safri.Many of our FoodAid recipients are like Safri.How You Can Help, and What Your Gift Will DoWith your gift, you can help people like Safri and his children get rid of food worries, and they’ll be able to buy and enjoy healthier food as a beneficiary of FoodAid.If you divided the $250 worth of food vouchers that feeds a family of four each month, it means less than $9/day for their meals… Probably lower than the cost of a large-sized cup of premium coffee that many of us enjoy regularly.While you don’t have to give up the little treats in life, you’ll likely find it more enjoyable and satisfying to gift a mere $3/day to families like Safri’s.If you can encourage 2 or 3 of your friends to join you in monthly gifting together, then it means a family of four will not have food worries for each month that they receive your support.I’d like to ask you for your help with giving the gift of FoodAid to such families. Your gift of $3/day will help them with a meal for a month.Together with 2 or 3 of your friends gifting $3 (or more, if you can, please) each per day, you can help a family with all their meals each month.You can help support 40 familiesWe’re looking to support 40 families for the next 1 month, and have set a modest goal of $10,000 for this.With your generous help and support, Singapore Red Cross and I hope to benefit 40 families, bring food to their tables, and get rid of their food worries for this month at least.On behalf of Safri and our beneficiaries, I thank you in advance for your generous gifts.Yours sincerely,Mr Benjamin WilliamSecretary General/CEO, Singapore Red CrossHow Your Contribution Helps﻿For the sake of transparency, as well as to help you realise the impact of your contribution, we’d like to share how your donation will help.S$25 will gift a family of four FoodAid vouchers to buy food for about 3 daysS$50 will gift a family of four FoodAid vouchers to buy food for about 6 daysS$100 will gift a family of four FoodAid vouchers to buy food for about 12 daysS$250 will gift a family of four FoodAid vouchers to buy food for a full monthYour generous donation will help provide a family with sustenance and security.

Singapore Red Cross Society,Gift your unused petrol spend to feed a hungry family today #wegiveinsolidarity,"Today, you can turn your unused petrol spend into a driving force to feed 100 hungry families for one monthDear friend,With the Circuit Breaker in play right now, you might be on work from home status, and do not need to drive out as much, or at all.I appeal to you to donate your unused petrol spend towards feeding at least 100 hungry families for one month.Not everyone is as lucky as you or I, and some have lost their jobs... Which means sole breadwinners can no longer put healthy food on their table to feed their children or themselves.“The monthly FoodAid worth $250 from the Singapore Red Cross benefit me and my family a lot because it enables us to have fresh food products, and my children can grow up healthily,” - Safri Bin SallehHow you can help, and what your gift will doWith your gift, you can help people like Safri and his children get rid of food worries, and they’ll be able to buy and enjoy healthier food as a beneficiary of FoodAid.If you divided the $250 worth of food vouchers that feeds a family of four each month, it means less than $9/day for their meals.While you don’t have to give up the little treats in life, you’ll likely find it more enjoyable and satisfying to gift a mere $3/day to families like Safri’s.If you can encourage 2 or 3 of your car-driving friends to join you in monthly gifting together, then it means a family of four will not have food worries for each month that they receive your support.I’d like to ask you for your help with giving the gift of FoodAid to such families. Your gift of $3/day will help them with a meal for a month.Together with 2 or 3 of your friends gifting $3 (or more, if you can, please) each per day, you can help a family with all their meals each month.You can help support 100 familiesWe're looking to support 100 families for the next 1 month, and have set a modest goal of $25,000 for this.With your generous help and support, Singapore Red Cross and I hope to benefit 100 families, bring food to their tables, and get rid of their food worries for this month at least.I hope you will support me in my cause by making a donation from your unused petrol spend. Thank you in advance.Donating is really simple and secure. The money will directly go to Singapore Red Cross.P.S. Any unutilised funds after COVID-19 is over will be channelled towards the Singapore Red Cross's local programmes"
Singapore Red Cross Society,Raya for Humanity,"At the tender age of 11 years old, Elyana faces a myriad of problems from family issues, poor grades and challenges with interpersonal relationships in school.Elyana’s family of 8 stays in a rental flat and she often experiences difficulty sleeping as she alternates between sleeping on the floor and in the bedroom. The living environment is unconducive for Elyana to focus on her studies and she finds herself not doing well enough in school. On top of that, her friends would say hurtful things to her but she kept it all to herself.She eventually found her way into the Singapore Red Cross’ Young Hearts programme in May 2022. Being a part of the Young Hearts programme enabled her to expand her horizons by going on outings to new places and attending tuition classes, where she could find temporary relief from the heavy burdens on her tiny shoulders.“I really enjoy the outings, such as the recent trip to the Universal Studios Singapore, where I have never been before,” said Elyana, “The tuition has also helped me to improve on my grades and made me a more responsible person.”With the guidance and support from staff and volunteers, Elyana’s grades and outlook in life has since improved. Today, she is more confident about paving her own future, and hopes to make further academic progress to do well for PSLE.This Hari Raya, join us in giving our young ones the opportunity to celebrate, enabling them to take a breather from their daily challenges. While we are unable to choose the environment we are born in, all children should receive equal opportunities to learn, advance in life and also have fun. With $100, you can support a child with two excursions, inclusive of entrance fees and transport. Share your well wishes in a gift today to send warmth and cheer; hope and strength!(All donations to local causes are 250% tax deductible.)"
Singapore Red Cross Society,Sustainable Kids Market 2024 by Peace of Art,"Amidst Singapore's towering skyline lies a concealed reality — 23,900 children live in public rental housing, grappling with the adversities of cramped living conditions and severely restricted opportunities.The Sustainable Kids Market 2024, taking place on May 25-26 at Marina Square, emerges as a groundbreaking catalyst for change — a first-of-its-kind community event committed to ensuring academic and mentorship support for children in public rental housing. The mission is clear: equip every child and member of the future generation with essential tools, despite circumstance or background.At the heart of this movement is the impactful KIDSforKIDS initiative, uniting children across the nation to empower their less fortunate peers through the transformative power of art. A child-centric theme, focused on The Art of Sustainable Living, weaves through various aspects of the Sustainable Kids Market, encompassing an art auction, public art collaboration, sustainable living workshops, and live performances.This unique event transforms every citizen into an advocate for Sustainable Living, and as well as a fundraiser for the underprivileged, exemplifying the democratisation of philanthropy, where even the youngest individual becomes a giver and change-maker.Your invaluable support will breathe life into the Young Hearts programme, delivering educational support, enrichment, and mentorship to empower these children, to break the intergenerational chains of vulnerability that entrap them. Together, let us confront the challenges faced by underprivileged children in our nation, charting a course toward a sustainable and inclusive future for Singapore.BENEFICIARYOur objective for the Sustainable Kids Market 2024 is to raise $100,000 in funding to facilitate the expansion of the Young Hearts programme by the Singapore Red Cross (Institute of Public Character), to support a greater number of underprivileged children with education and mentorship, as well as to provide them with opportunities that will be otherwise out of reach.The program includes:● Education for children between four to 18 years old to enhance literacy and confidence.● Mentorship to enrich their development through a positive and holistic approach adopted by volunteers who serve as positive role models to provide the children with guidance, mentorship and motivation.● Enrichment through targeted programmes and personal development workshops with partners to nurture the students by equipping them with character development opportunities, skills and abilities.ORGANISERPeace of Art is a unique not-for-profit organisation with the mission to embed The Art of Sustainable Living into the cultural fabric of our nation, and bolster the support for underprivileged children to foster a Sustainable Future for Singapore, through community engagement and corporate involvement.Distinguishing itself from other philanthropic fundraisers, Peace of Art maintains a 100% Impact policy — we give 100% of what we raise — ensuring every donation received will reach the underprivileged individuals we serve. We are committed to operating without any compensation from the donated funds, through the dedicated volunteerism of business leaders and professionals, families and children."

Singapore Red Cross Society,Be our GLADiator for Desolate Seniors. Help Defeat Loneliness in 2020.,"Dear Friend,My name is Benjamin William, CEO and Sec Gen of Singapore Red Cross.I've seen with my own eyes what it's like to be old, hungry, alone -- with no one to care. And it's a sight that breaks my heart!That's why the Singapore Red Cross and I decided to do something to come to the rescue of the elderly in our local community who, through no fault of their own, have been forced into a plight sometimes worse than death!But I can't do this job alone. Right now, Singapore has at least 65,000 seniors living alone, with no one to talk to, and no one to see to them. For 2020, we are looking to support more than 174 such seniors for at least 12 months.  That's why I'm searching for friends like yourself who will join me in the HoME+ program that brings friendship and assurance with help that is just one call-out button away. How HoME+ WorksAs these seniors live alone and may not be mobile-literate, they face difficulties seeking medical attention if they are unwell, or if they encounter home accidents.Through HoME+, motion sensors and panic buttons are installed in their homes linked to our 24/7 helpline, where we can monitor and respond to their needs. In serious cases, our network of community responders will make personal visits to check on their condition.With a simple gift of $48, you can support a lonely senior with the HoME+ programme for a month, and just $576 will support them for the entire year.I hope that you'll find it in your heart to support one of our local elderly for at least a month. You could be their GLADiator (Gift of Love And Dignity) and give them a little ray of hope today.Your donation will also be 2.5x tax deductible.Thank you.Sincerely yours,Benjamin WilliamCEO / Secretary GeneralSingapore Red Cross P.S. Our goal is to establish help for 174 seniors for one year in the next 120 days. By raising funds, your donations and funds raised will be used now and throughout the year to support the HoME+ programme to help at least 174 vulnerable elderly in Singapore. Will you help us?"

Singapore Red Cross Society,(DM) Brightening Days With Love,"Dear Friend,I am Subathra D/O Manikam, but most people call me Suba. I am 67 years old, and for the past four decades, I've been battling an auto-immune disease that has significantly adversely impacted my life.Besides having a coma, I had undergone two surgeries. These surgeries, unfortunately, led to complications that brought about blood clots in my legs, which impaired my mobility. Heading out for my medical appointments became a dreaded task that triggered much fear, apprehension, and uncertainty. I would painstakingly manoeuvre myself on a wheelchair out of my home, and flag a taxi to get to my medical appointments. Often, the taxis would speed by without stopping. In the rare instances where the taxi driver kindly gave me a ride, the rides were costly. I was subsequently introduced to the Singapore Red Cross’ (SRC) Medical Chaperone and TransportAid service. It was akin to a ray of hope shining in my life. Since then, a medical chaperone from SRC would fetch me to and from my regular medical appointments at the hospital via the TransportAid vehicle. Occasionally, they would go above and beyond their call of duty by helping me with daily tasks such as packing lunch for me. I am thankful to SRC’s medical chaperones for their cherished friendship and presence in my life, which has given me the peace of mind and enabled me to get to my medical appointments with ease. With love,SubaAll funds raised through this campaign will be under Be Our Champion for Humanity--As the year draws to a close, we hope you will consider making a monthly donation while joining us as a Champion of the Singapore Red Cross. Your generosity will go a long way to touching the lives and addressing the needs of underserved communities in Singapore, by giving them the hope of a better year ahead!Together, let’s make a difference in the lives of the less privileged, giving them the opportunity to usher in the new year on a brighter note."

A smaller 5.7 magnitude earthquake struck the same area a day before. The earthquake triggered landslides in at least 3 areas, with electricity and communication networks being temporarily disrupted. As of 15 January, at least 42 fatalities and more than 637 injuries have been reported. Multiple buildings have suffered damages, including the local airport at Mamju and a hospital. Over 300 houses have also sustained damages, with more than 15,000 people temporarily displaced in 10 evacuation sites.Mr Benjamin William, Secretary General and CEO of Singapore Red Cross, said, “We are deeply saddened by the lives lost after Indonesia was once again struck by a major earthquake. The ongoing global pandemic will further complicate the response to this disaster. Our counterparts at PMI are currently engaged in search and rescue operations, with specialist ambulance crews and first aid teams deployed on the ground to treat people injured in the earthquake. The full extent of the devastation is still unfolding - with an increasing number of fatalities, hundreds of collapsed houses and buildings, and tens of thousands of homeless people.”South Kalimantan FloodsAccording to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent, the floods have affected more than 220,000 persons with about 40,000 displaced persons and 25,000 houses destroyed. Five districts in South Kalimantan province have been affected - Banjar, Tanah Laut, Tapin, Balangan, Hulu Sungai Tengah) - with the worst affected areas being Banjar and Tanah Laut.Mr William explained, “As the heavy rains persist, there is no sign of respite from the floods for the affected communities in South Kalimantan and the situation is likely to worsen in the coming days. The floods have caused much damage to infrastructure, including the network of roads and bridges. This poses difficulty to not just the search and rescue efforts, but also the delivery of humanitarian supplies to the affected areas. PMI has been actively responding to both disasters, supporting the affected communities with food and relief, besides the rescue operations. We stand in solidarity with our Indonesian neighbours during this difficult time.”SRC has also activated its “Restoring Family Links” (RFL) service to assist Singaporeans and others to locate their immediate family members who may have been affected by the disaster with whom they have difficulty in contacting. For assistance, please contact SRC at rfl@redcross.sg.

She looks forward to interacting with others, going out on outings and attending celebrations. When communicating with others, she demonstrates determination and patience by repeating herself to ensure she is understood.Over the years, her amiable personality has endeared her to many; she has forged countless friendships with volunteers, visitors and nurses, who would set aside time to care for and interact with her. She also has a sentimental side. She keeps a special phone book consisting of her friends' contact details and would often ask for stationery so that she can write to them, albeit with the help of volunteers or caregivers.With the support and love of many, Bee Lian has been able to thrive and forge lasting memories.Be the Champion and Change!Give a Gift that Goes a Longer Way!Supporting the needs of vulnerable communities; the isolated elderly, persons with severe disabilities and the families-in-need; continues to be at the heart of our work.

Every day, he relies on his mama for his daily activities, and uses a motorised wheelchair to get around.His papa is the family's sole breadwinner. Alas, he too has a host of medical issues. His salary from part-time driving is insufficient to cover the family's living expenses.It was only after the Red Cross reached out to support the family that they ate regular, nutritious meals. With the supermarket vouchers they receive each month, they bought foods that didn't just fill their bellies, but were beneficial to health. With their financial burden lifted, the family has more reasons to smile.'The Red Cross vouchers help a lot. Now, we can buy salmon, cheese, vegetables, fruits and brown rice. These foods are fresh and healthy. Thank you for helping us.' - The Ng FamilyYour generous donations will uplift families like the Ng family. Help us help more today."

Singapore Red Cross Society,Uplift the lives of 100 vulnerable families this Hari Raya!,"Gift a green packet to put food on the table for vulnerable families we serve this Ramadan! Your contribution will go a long way to uplift the lives of 100 families in our community. Sharifah Bte Heron's life has not been easy. Born with eight holes in her heart, she has always struggled with an ailing constitution. Yet, as the oldest child, she had to step up and support her family at the tender age of 12, after her father left them. She had to abandon her studies so that she could work and look after her siblings and her wheelchair-bound mother. After Sharifah tied the knot and had kids, the responsibility of taking care of Sharifah’s children was taken up by her mother, who also had to care for Sharifah's auntie, who has special needs. The caretaking, unfortunately, took a toll on her mother. As a result, Sharifah stopped working to care for her children. Being a mom is no easy task, and especially for Sharifah whose twin boys were diagnosed with Global Developmental Delay and Autism a few years ago. Sharifah's husband, who works as a pest controller, now takes on the role of the sole breadwinner of the family. His salary alone is, however, insufficient to support the family's needs, including the children's medical fees. With help from the SRC - Aviva Meals with Love programme, Sharifah receives $250 dollars worth of supermarket vouchers monthly, which enables her to put nutritious food on the table for the family. ""I would like to express my gratitude to the Singapore Red Cross. The vouchers have helped my family greatly. In the past, we could only afford to have soup every meal as it was the cheapest thing to buy in the market. Now, my children can consume more nutritious food such as chicken and milk,"" shared Sharifah. Share your blessings with those around you and make a donation today! A gift of $250 can provide food for a family of four for 1 month. Ramadan is a time to reflect, do good, and spend time with loved ones. While we count our blessings with our families this Ramadan and Hari Raya, let's spare a thought for families who need a little more help. Your contributions will empower us to help more families, like Sharifah's! Please help us help more!"

Singapore Red Cross Society,Afghanistan Drought Relief,"13 million lack food as drought crisis bitesIn response to the ongoing drought in Afghanistan, the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) has launched a public appeal to support the ongoing humanitarian efforts by the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS), a member of the Early Action Committee (EAC) established by the Government of Afghanistan to work on the current drought issues. All funds raised will be channeled towards the relief and recovery of affected communities, with a focus on mobile medical camps, emergency healthcare and medical equipment for the most remote areas.Intervention activities conducted by the ARCS includes livelihood restoration and protection such as community-based income generation activities, training in entrepreneurship, and seed capital for project start-up. Many of these activities will prioritise women and female-led households, in particular those who have been widowed by the conflict.In the area of Health, ARCS will be organising community-based hygiene promotion activities with a focus on education to inspire and empower community members to improve their hygiene knowledge and practices. Other activities that this appeal will support include mobile medical camps, which provide primary healthcare services to the most remote areas.Since October 2020, Afghanistan has been experiencing severe droughts due to below-normal rainfall as a result of a La Niña phenomenon. These conditions are expected to continue through the first half of 2021. The situation is further exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic and other complications already faced in Afghanistan, such as food insecurity, conflict, and high prices of basic commodities. These issues continue to disproportionately affect women and children.In affected provinces, the drought has affected the provision of health care services due to stretched capacities as emergency health and water needs rise in affected areas. The drought has also affected people's income and livelihood, resulting in increased food insecurity.Notes:Donations to overseas efforts are not tax-deductible.In the event that donations exceed the expenses incurred by Singapore Red Cross in this specific disaster response, any surplus or unspent money, after 3 years from the date of inception of the fund, can be used to prepare for and serve communities affected by other disasters or may be used to complement or to sustain projects undertaken by SRC in helping the vulnerable in areas affected by disasters.About Singapore Red CrossSingapore Red Cross is a homegrown humanitarian organisation, dedicated to relieving human suffering, protecting lives and dignity, and responding to emergencies since 1949.

National Arthritis Foundation,Arthritis Hurts - You can help soothe the pain (NAF Mail Donation Appeal),"As early as Primary 2, Esther struggled to walk the short distance to school. Her mother felt something was amiss and brought her to the hospital for checks. Even though initial test results came back normal, she would often wake up in pain in the middle of the night. At school, she had to change her CCA three times – from skipping, to choir, to art – when regular activities became difficult to accomplish. Persistent in finding out what was ailing her daughter, Esther's mother pursued in seeking a diagnosis. Esther was in Primary 5 when she was finally diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis(JIA), a lifelong and incurable condition that causes pain and stiffness in the spine. It can eventually lead to a total fusion of the spine and may result in a hunched posture. Today, Esther relies on medication administered via an injector pen every two weeks to help with her condition, although there is to date no permanent cure for JIA. The regular injections have kept her pain-free although the arthritis may be triggered whenever she is stressed. Her family worries about the cost of treatment, which is long-term. Medication for arthritis patients can cost as much as $30,000 a year and many require continuous treatment to manage their ailment. NAF helps patients like Esther with her medical costs so that she has a chance of living a normal childhood. Your donation will change someone's life."

National Arthritis Foundation,Arthritis is debilitating for all ages,"Arthritis makes one's joints inflamed, making it hard for sufferers to perform any form of physical activity and affecting their work, relationships and even the ability to carry out daily tasks such as eating and sleeping.Arthritis is also not a disease of the old. It can happen to anyone, especially those between 25 and 40 like Nina.Soon after the birth of her son, Nina discovered she had Rheumatoid Arthritis.""I could not even hold up a plastic bag of bread, I could not lift up a glass of water, the whole experience was him [her son] seeing me in bed most of the time in pain.'' She lamented, “I don’t have a lot of memories of doing a lot of things activities that mothers typically do.” Arthritis may also occur among those younger. Ryan, was only 18 when he was diagnosed.“I had about 10 months of pain in my wrists before I got to find out what it was,” he recounted, “I could not sleep. I was opening doors with my elbows”.However, many treatments options to alleviate the pain have severe side effects, as Ryan describes, “I was taking the same drug that you use for chemotherapy. It was giving me a lot of side effects like brain fog, I was having a lot of nausea, vomiting and I found it very difficult to cope.”Faced with this issue, An Na, mother of 9 year-old with arthritis, was worried for her daughter, “My biggest fear is that, what are the side effects of taking this strong medication? Effective treatment with minimal side effects is available for them, but it can come at a cost of more than $36,000 every year. However, for most families in Singapore, this is something they cannot afford, even with government subsidies like Medisave, Medifund, MAF and MAF plus. This is why our Patient Subsidy Care Fund supports arthritis patients who cannot afford it. For beneficiaries with more severe conditions, we also sponsor medical aids and equipment to facilitate their movements, and transportation arrangements to and from hospitals. In Singapore, over 45,000 people like Nina, Ryan and An Na's daughter suffer from Arthritis, and we want to help many more in need. However, as a charity, our funds are limited.But you can help by contributing to our Patient Subsidy Care Fund that helps underprivileged patients with subsidies for their treatments. As we are an IPC-status charity, you will also receive a 250% tax rebate if your donation is $50 and above. The monthly treatment of biologics for someone with arthritis costs $2000, but no amount is too small. Even $50 will help someone like Nina, Ryan and An Na's daughter be one step closer to getting a sense of normalcy.Your gift will change the lives of many like them and help NAF further its objectives in fighting arthritis. “During that time where she was taking steroids before the biologic agents, I was like going through a dark tunnel that we don’t know how long the tunnel was and see the bright…*voice cracks*. It is a miracle for her. She is now like any other normal girl, and we are thankful for that."" - An Na, mother of a 9 year-old with ArthritisThank you in advance for your generosity."
National Arthritis Foundation,NAF Charity Gala Dinner 2019,"National Arthritis Foundation (NAF) is a registered charity body under the Ministry of Health founded in 1984. The primary role of NAF is to provide medical subsidies to help needy Singaporeans suffering from arthritis. Each year, NAF needs to raise around $500,000 to meet its objectives in providing patient treatment subsidy, patient education and for our general operations.Currently, the most effective treatment for both adult and juvenile arthritis patients is the use of biologic agents which are costly, ranging from $24,000 to $30,000 per annum for an average Rheumatoid Arthritis patient. This makes it unaffordable in the long run for most families even after using government grants such as Medisave, Medifund, MAF and MAF plus. One of NAF’s role is to supplement the funding needs of arthritis patients deserving of financial assistance, so that all patients have access to effective treatment in order to lead normal and productive lives. In addition, NAF’s long-term plan therefore is to raise over 3-5 million dollars over the next 3-5 years to help us set-up and run Arthritis Clinics in Singapore. Tonight, at NAF’s Charity Gala Dinner 2019, we hope to raise $30,000. We therefore appeal to your generosity to help us with the necessary funds to fulfil our objectives. As a token of our appreciation for your donations, we are gifting donors who donate $200 or more with gifts that have been contributed by our sponsors.

National Arthritis Foundation,NAF Charity Golf 2021,"Singapore is expected to have over 1 million residents above 65 years old by 2030. Invariably, this translates to a higher proportion of people living with musculoskeletal conditions like osteoarthritis, one of the commonest forms of disability.

For this reason, NAF plans to set up our first arthritis patient service centre where we will provide facilities and services to help patients better manage their condition and enable them to enjoy an improved quality of life. In addition, NAF has been providing medical subsidies to help needy Singaporeans and Permanent Residents suffering from arthritis since its founding in 1984 and funds raised through our fundraisers help us continue the work that we do, including mobilising the community through programmes and workshops that empower them with knowledge to better cope with arthritis.We therefore appeal for your strong support to join us at the NAF Charity Golf 2021. The NAF Charity Golf 2021 will be held at the beautiful Tanah Meran Country Club's Tampines Course on Friday, 19 March 2021.

National Arthritis Foundation,Amee Parikh - Support my effort to fight arthritis,"I'm a volunteer with National Arthritis Foundation (NAF) by serving on its board. NAF is an IPC-status charity devoted to arthritis sufferers in Singapore. Arthritis is an incurable disease that causes inflammation in one or more of the joints. If left untreated, the condition can affect one's ability to perform common, everyday activities that you and I often take for granted. While it is most typically found within the elderly community, arthritis is a disease that affects people of all ages. Arthritis is not just an ""old age"" condition but afflicts the young as well and the sooner patients receive care, the better their chances at living a better life. To attend to the expected increase in arthritis sufferers, NAF needs to raise funds to subsidise its underprivileged patients and continue its mission of providing care and educating arthritis sufferers. Please join me in my efforts to fight arthritis by donating to this meaningful cause. Thank you!For more information: www.naf.org.sg"

Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore,Improving Physiotherapy Intervention Through Technology #CPASALLIEDHEALTH,"Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a physical disability that affects movement and posture. It is caused by illness or injury to the brain before or during birth, or early in life.Physiotherapy (PT) is one of the Allied Health services provided by CPAS. Our team of physiotherapists provide comprehensive assessment & customized treatment to improve gross motor functioning. Gross motor skills involve movements of the large muscles of the arms, legs, & torso in activities such as sitting, standing, walking with or without a mobility & running.At present more than 50% of our clients are classified at GMFCS Levels IV and V which means that most of them have physical limitations, making them entirely dependent on mobility aids such as assisted walker & wheelchairs for their functional needs.PT hopes to procure equipment that could be used to achieve better therapy outcomes. With technology as a key enabler, initiatives such as the Physitrack App was introduced over the circuit breaker to empower caregivers to conduct prescribed therapy sessions at home.Advanced rehabilitative technology such as the Alter-G, an Anti Gravity threadmill & the Motek C-Mill VR+, an interactive equipment that provides visual & audio stimuli to make therapy fun, have been introduced. These equipment provide real time data that allows our physiotherapists to make changes, track the effectiveness of therapy and make informed decisions.Your donation will help us to maintain & improve our therapy services.Thank you!"

Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore,65 Years of Empowering Lives #CPAS65,"Since our establishment in 1957, Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore (CPAS) has provided special education, therapy services, assistive equipment and specialised care to our beneficiaries with cerebral palsy and multiple disabilities.Our beneficiaries require these essential programmes and services to live as independently as possible, and access opportunities that are available for people without disabilities. However, access to such programmes and services is challenging for many beneficiaries and their families.65 years ago, CPAS began as a single class for 10 children with cerebral palsy. The kind support that we have received over the past years have enabled us to become a one-stop centre that can provide subsidised programmes and services to our beneficiaries. This has been pivotal in the growth and development of our beneficiaries, and the access to essential programmes and services is instrumental in allowing them to reach their fullest potential.As we commemorate our 65th anniversary, we thank you for your support on behalf of our beneficiaries here at CPAS. Your continued support will go a long way in helping over 700 children and adults live fulfilled, dignified lives.Thank you!#CPAS65"
Animal Lovers League,"Help Armstrong, Ashley & other rescued dogs","ALL is a no-kill shelter that gives each life a fighting chance and will explore any possibility if there is a vestige of hope for all its rescues. Immediate lifesaving treatment is needed for some of its rescues. Fraught with the heightened cost of living worldwide, ALL is left with large veterinary bills that continue to accumulate.Armstrong is our dear gentle giant. A lump on his rump has led to the very sad discovery of a soft tissue sarcoma. He underwent a surgery to remove the lump, assumed benign, but was determined otherwise and has recurred after about two months. After getting a CT scan and seeking a specialist's opinion, we have been advised that Armstrong will need a series of tests and surgeries to try to save his life. Ashley is another rescued dog who suddenly lost function of her hind legs in early-2023. She would move around using only her front legs, dragging her back legs on the ground. After much rehabilitation, veterinary care and hydro- theraphy, she was well on the road to recovery and regained use of her hind legs in late-2023. We were so heartened by her tenacity to live! However, Ashley's case has taken a turn for the worse as her condition has caused her bladder to be twisted causing urinary retention. With multiple surgeries and procedures to correct this, she remains alert, energetic and bright. This girl really wants to live! There continues to be many vet visits, urinary catheterisations, prescription food and surgery for Ashley -- we will continue to fight alongside her.ALL of these are stories of hope, resilience and compassion at Animal Lovers League. But, they would not have been possible without constant treatments and checkups, which are fuelled by our kind donors. Your support helps to transform an animal's life, and help them become the bubbly friend they are again. Every paw deserves a chance, and every act of kindness makes a world of difference.  "
Animal Lovers League,"Help Ashley, Snickers, Brown & other rescues","As one of the largest and longest serving animal welfare groups in Singapore, ALL is a no-kill shelter that values life and explores every possibility if there is a vestige of hope for all its despondent rescues but Veterinary costs have always been one of it's greatest challenges.Injured or abused rescues usually require consistent care while most others may require immediate lifesaving medical intervention. Check out Ashley - Ashley is a bubbly rescued dog who suddenly lost the use her hind legs. She would trudge along using only her front legs, with her back legs dragging. Multiple Vet visits and tests finally revealed that she had developed a spinal infection. She is now slowly recovering by attending hydrotherapy sessions to regain muscle strength in her rear lower limbs. Ashley also requires regular vet check ups from her hydrotherapy to monitor her progress, all of which amounts to a significant amount of money but we will not give up on her.Check out Snickers and Brown - Snickers and Brown are our senior rescued cats. Snickers was a stray cat while Brown was rescued from a home that could no longer care for him. As with many senior animals, both Snickers and Brown were observed to have shed weight. Upon Vet visits and tests, we found kidney disease to be the cause. Despite the prognosis, we persevered to fight for Snickers and Brown. The immediate life saving treatments they received worked! Their immense love for life is empirical and are now sustaining on regular Vet visits, fluid therapy, long-term prescribed renal diets, daily medications and supplements to keep them healthier and content.(Snickers here)(Brown here)It is very unfortunate that such debilities should afflict them but they will never be forsaken. These are narratives of some of the rescued animals in our care. Together, your donations make a BIG difference in saving and sustaining lives. Please donate towards their care and be instrumental in helping and caring for these lives.Ps - At ALL, we cherish lives as we are wired that way!"
Animal Lovers League,Will You Help Us Feed Our Furry Friends?,"As a strictly no-kill shelter and home to over 500 vagrant strays, abandoned, traumatized, abused, and rescued cats and dogs, it is hard to imagine the amount of effort that our founders, Cathy and Mohan, as well as volunteers, put into to care for our furry friends. Our daily tasks include feeding them, treating sick animals, bringing them for veterinary checkups and when they are sick or injured, vaccinating them against illnesses, and neutering/sterilizing them.On top of the already hefty medical bills, a bulk of the expenses comes from the need to feed over 500 empty stomachs EVERY single day. However, as the ongoing pandemic has curtailed many of the conventional fundraising and adoption events that we were able to count on previously, we face increasing difficulties in coping with the daily food supply needs. Your help is needed to fill their stomach. Usage of FundThe funds raised through this campaign will be used to purchase the food needed from Sun Petgamart.The reason for choosing the specific supplier is because of the following:They have been our regular supplier for a long timeThey know our food requirements - our dogs and cats are accustomed to specific brands and get a lot of gastro issues when we mix or change their food. A list of our animal friends favorite food includes:Dog food: Daily Delight, Cesar Beef, Nature's Gift, Hill’s Science Diet Adult Dog Dry Food    Cat food: Science Diet Optimal Care for Cats, Bistro Chicken, Arisocat Premium Plus Tuna with Salmon/Crab MeatThey have kept the prices very low and affordable. For sparing about $25, you can secure roughly a week's food supply for one of our furry friends! Your contribution will go a long way to support our continuous effort to care for every animal rescued. We seek your kind donations in this."
Animal Lovers League,The Sick and Infirm at Pets Villa Need Your Help,"Animal Lovers League runs Pets Villa where the old, abused, and abandoned live their lives out for whatever time that is left for them.Of the many, Johnny Cash is a stray with a festering wound on his head for as long as we had been feeding him in the streets. We then decided it was time to bring him in. Numerous treatments thereafter by Vets revealed his wound to be cancerous. We are taking care and nursing him daily and his wound is significantly improving. This eighteen year old boy eats well and enjoys his walks.Ah Lian is the only surviving sibling of Ah Huey and Ah Beng. We found them in the monsoon drain 16 years ago just outside the shelter when we were still at Pasir Ris. They were only 2 months old then. She is now enfeebled by a geriatric arthritic condition. She still has her zest for life though.  Lucy is a candidate of our ""Trap, Neuter, Release"" Project. She looked so pathetic, and still does, that our conscience didn’t allow us to put her back in the streets. Lucy is about 16 years old. She came to us emaciated and frightened. She now has cataracts and is slow but her energy, appetite and activity levels are good. Betsy looks older than her 12 years. Owner abandoned her because of her poor condition. She is blind, hairless and mostly recumbent. Now better with her movement and appetite. These are only a few of others that are more or less like they.They fare well when given their supplements and medical care for whatever that ails them. Medical bills can be daunting, and to date we have chalked up a sum of $33k.We seek your help to settle these medical arrears so that our work for these unfortunate animals can perpetuate. All excess funds will be utilised for their on-going medical needs.Cathy & Mohan Animal Lovers League"

Animal Lovers League,Help Shelter ALL's Rescues This 2021,"""As we collectively struggle to adapt to a new norm, we once again reach out for urgent assistance to ensure that Animal Lovers League will not be forced to shut its doors.""﻿Dear friends,Your generous response to our last appeal had allowed us to substantially reduce our medical bills and ancillary charges. With an aging population of dogs and cats, we prioritize these payments to ensure that the animals under our care can receive prompt and necessary medical care. From something as simple as an abscess to critical illness such as cancer and tumors the welfare of these helpless creatures is foremost in our minds.However, as the ongoing pandemic has curtailed many of the conventional fundraising and adoption events that we were able to count on, we are once again in arrears on our rental payments. As we collectively struggle to adapt to a new norm, we once again reach out for urgent assistance to ensure that Animal Lovers League will not be forced to shut its doors.Our fervent hope is to raise a sum of $144,000 to enable us to meet our rental needs for 2021. Please treat this as an on-going appeal till we are able to meet our target.We are a no-kill shelter because we believe that every animal rescued should be given a 2nd chance at life and all in our care should be allowed to transition naturally. We hope that all of you will help us to start this new year with renewed hope and the faith that no matter how dark the night, the light of day will always be available to us and the helpless animals under our care."
Animal Lovers League,Help Ebony and other rescued animals in need of medical care,"Our 4-year-old Ebony was born in Animal Lovers League's shelter. His Mummy was rescued when heavily pregnant with Ebony and his brother, Ivory.Last July, Ivory was diagnosed with FIP and he fought extremely hard to stay alive through it all. He unfortunately succumbed to the fatal condition in October, leaving Ebony and his Mummy behind. The trio were very close and Ebony found solace and friendship in the other cats in the shelter.In late November, we noticed a lesion on Ebony's head around the right ear which was more like a scabbing wound. However, in the week that followed, it grew aggressively into a round lump more than an inch in diameter, bloody too at that!Ebony is scheduled to undergo surgery tomorrow (7 December 2021) to remove the growths and have them sent for testing. We are keeping our fingers crossed and are praying this is not cancer and is a treatable condition.Ebony is one of many rescued animals in Animal Lovers League that are desperate for funds to support their medical care. We seek your kindness once again to pray for our very young Ebony and to donate to his medical care if you can. Any amount donated will help alleviate the monetary veterinary cost of caring for Ebony and ALL's rescued animals in need. Thank you for your generosity. ﻿#ALLThatMatters"
Animal Lovers League,"Help John, Little John, Amber & other rescued animals","Animal Lovers League is a no-kill shelter in Singapore. It cares for about 500 rescued cats and dogs who were once injured, abandoned, abused and traumatised pets or strays.As a no-kill shelter that values life and explores every visage of hope for all its rescues regardless of their age, injury or condition, veterinary bills are one of its constant struggles. Some of the rescues in its care require regular and lifelong medical care, while others may require immediate lifesaving treatment. Here are some stories of the rescues under ALL's charge.SamanthaOur dear Samantha (endearingly known to many as Sam) is a lovely Singapore Special. All this time, she has been a rambunctious and healthy dog. She's a cat-loving dog and spent most of her time hanging out with the cats in ALL's cattery. In 2021, her health started to take a turn. She started losing weight and was later determined to have kidney disease.On top of vet services like tests, procedures and hospitalisation she has required the past months, maintaining regular medical needs that keep Samantha healthy and well can come up to at least $500 a month. Her routine includes 1000ml Hartmann's subcutaneous drips, supplements for his kidney health, vet visits to check her condition and a special diet specific for optimising kidney health.John and Little JohnJohn and Little John are siblings who were rescued together. Being stray dogs from birth, they are very skittish and remain wary of people. Recently, both brothers developed a very bad cough that quickly led to pneumonia. They require round the clock medical attention to ensure they receive sufficient oxygen and IV fluids.Emergency medical cases like these can arise at any time, and ALL is always on alert to ensure animals in need get the medical attention they need at the drop of a pin.AmberAmber is a regular blood donor who has saved lives of other cats in dire need. This loving, calm and gentle ginger cat makes visits to the vet very pleasant. All vets who have met him have share the same story — Amber is so calm, he doesn’t require any sedation when donating blood. To make Amber even more amazing, he LOVES dogs! And dogs love him right back.Recently, Amber was diagnosed with kidney insufficiency and had to be brought to the vet for immediate care. His temperature was very low, but our fighter continues to fight and push ahead. We pray that Amber’s renal issues are acute and can be corrected. Amber is one of many cats (both stray and pets) who suffer from kidney problems. He will require a prescribed long-term renal diet and possible subcutaneous fluids to keep him healthy, hopefully for a long time to come. Prescription cat diets that a number of ALL’s cats require can cost up to $500 each month, not including veterinary check ups that help check if the diets are working.MidnightOur dear Midnight was brought to the vet when he started losing weight. During his first vet visit, he was found to be FIV positive -- which explained why his mouth is always uncomfortable and why he is always drooling. He was also dehydrated and severely anaemic. Vets prescribed antibiotics and an injection to ease the pain in his mouth.During his latest review, tests revealed his anaemia had not improved and his blood count remained low -- which explained his uneasiness, the constant drooling and foaming.

APSN Ltd.,Double Up for Good,"35-year-old Germaine, who has mild intellectual disability and Down syndrome, graduated from APSN Centre for Adults in 2017 after securing employment. Unfortunately, when the Covid-19 pandemic struck, Germaine found herself facing unemployment. Recognising the need for continued support and training, Germaine’s mother re-enrolled Germaine at the APSN Centre for Adults in 2021.During her training, Germaine’s mood fluctuations often affected her work tasks. She was also easily distracted by others and became temperamental whenever there were changes in routine. To aid Germaine, her form instructor, Max Liong, designed a personalised checklist and set goals to help her improve on her ability to focus, work well with others, adapt to changes in routine and be more receptive to feedback.Through continuous guidance and with the support of her peers, Germaine is now able to manage distractions, cope well with her work tasks and has better relationships with her peers. To further support her needs, we also provide financial aid through our financial assistance scheme to cover her training fees and insurance, and also provide transport and meal allowances.Germaine’s mother has also noticed the significant improvements in her daughter. She has shared that Germaine pro-actively takes care of her whenever she is unwell and also attends to household chores. Her mother is also pleased with Germaine’s ability to regulate her emotions and newfound openness in sharing her daily experiences.Your contribution can make a profound impact on the lives of individuals like Germaine by supporting our vocational training programmes and employment support services. Every dollar helps, even a contribution of $2 can make a difference in empowering our trainees to become active contributors to society and lead independent and fulfilling lives.

Even at home, she constantly argued with her family members whenever she was being corrected and sometimes returned home late without informing her caregivers.Recognising the need for improvement, her form instructor, Lee See, with the support of our other instructors, stepped in to help Zabrina develop her social skills. Lee See also worked with Zabrina’s caregivers to plan household responsibilities for Zabrina and provided advice on how they can balance the aspects of nurture and discipline at home.With the support provided to her, Zabrina has learnt to regulate her emotions and has a more amicable relationship with her peers. She is now good at following instructions and enjoys a better relationship with her caregivers. Through her hard work, Zabrina has passed her Exposure Vocational Training Programme milestones and is waiting to transition to our Specialised Vocational Training Programme at the APSN Café for All.Our beneficiaries’ transformative journeys are only made possible with your invaluable support. Your donation empowers our beneficiaries, like Zabrina, to work towards becoming active contributors to the community by equipping them with the necessary skills required for the workforce through vocational training, realistic on-the-job training and employment support services. Make a donation today to empower our beneficiaries to lead independent and fulfilling lives."

When the 26-year-old with mild intellectual disability first joined APSN Centre for Adults in March 2023, she struggled to adapt to the new environment and had difficulty keeping up with her vocational training programme. With encouragement from her supportive instructors and peers, Nisha gradually warmed up to those around her and began to adapt well to the vocational training schedule. Nisha’s passion for gardening bloomed during her horticulture lessons.

Nisha’s family is also pleased with the remarkable improvements in her vocational skills and social skills. Nisha’s journey towards leading an independent and fulfilling life would not have been possible without the unwavering support of donors like yourself.

Kampung Senang Charity & Education Foundation,Gift of Good Food - A Compassion Support Scheme,"What does it mean to the recipient of a care pack?It is not only a bag full of healthy food and snacks to help our beneficiaries focus on making life improvement and recovery and not to worry about their next meal, but most importantly, it is to provide emotional support by showing them that we CARE and we are here to HELP. The Gift of Good Food programme is part of our Compassion Support Scheme which was launched in 2015 for natural therapy , TCM , pain management and nutritious meals for less privileged, chronically sick and cancer patients of all age groups to minimise their sufferings. Every year, volunteers make home visits to more than 2,500 cancer survivors bearing healthy food and snacks.With the large number of beneficiaries, the package delivery not only gives a chance for us to meet the beneficiaries and ask them how they are, it is also a time for us to check on them and ask if they need assistance. The visit itself is significant to some, checking on that elderly or whether the sick could still come out to answer the door and not suffered from a fall that had gone unnoticed as no one visited them.These are why care packs matter, it is important to remind them that they ARE NOT abandoned.In addition, the rising inflation coupled with our beneficiaries inability to work consistently, had taken a toll on their life-savings. The items in the care pack could wipe their worries away for a couple of days and help them get through this difficult time. But we could never do this alone and we sincerely NEED your assistance to help us continue our cause to support more of those in need. With every $40 donation, you will be able to sponsor a Care Package for one of our lonely seniors or a chronic illness patient and provide them with necessary nutrients they need to strengthen their body’s ability to heal itself! Your gift will leave a lasting impact towards their wellbeing for the rest of their lives.

All of these intimately connected to maintaining physical health.”  Alex LowSupport Scheme Beneficiary“My advice to anyone wanting to understand and learn more about complementary therapies is to visit Kampung Senang Member’s Day. I highly recommend people looking to manage chronic conditions to become a member and take advantage of the resources and therapies in Kampung Senang.”  Peter LimCancer Survivor“In 2012, my relative recommended Kampung Senang to me after I had undergone radiation and chemotherapy for nose and throat cancer. I have been coming here since to do therapies such as the torsion field, hydro-bath, and qigong. I feel blessed to have work with the wonderful people at Kampung Senang.”  Jenny Ng, Cancer SurvivorSURVIVING CANCER FOR TWENTY YEARSTwenty years ago, I was diagnosed with lymphoma and underwent chemotherapy. Upon the advice of a trusted friend, I switched over completely to a plant-based diet. When Kampung Senang came into existence, I started coming to its educational talks, workshops, and seminars, and to borrow its collection of books on dealing with cancer holistically. The knowledge and experiences I gained gave me the reassurance and confidence that changing my diet was the right thing to do. My lifestyle today incorporates natural therapies and TCM. Ever since I have had no reason to visit my oncologist. In the past year, I discovered Member’s Day at Kampung Senang and have been coming to this event regularly. It gives me a reason to exercise, do qigong, yoga, torsion field therapy, and participate in sharing sessions to experience lots of interesting therapies. There are talks on enzymes, juicing, diet. It is all very empowering. Peter Lim, Cancer SurvivorRECOVERING FROM CANCERIn 2012, my relative recommended Kampung Senang to me after I had undergone radiation and chemotherapy for nose and throat cancer. I have been coming here since to do therapies such as the torsion field, hydro-bath, and qigong. My wife and I have attended an excellent healthy diet and cooking classes, and, as a result, have transformed our eating habits. Today, my health is good. My taste buds are back and my doctor is very impressed with my health. I feel very blessed to have been able to work with the wonderful people at Kampung Senang.Alex Low, Compassion Support Scheme Beneficiary LEARNING ABOUT COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIESI have tried various therapies as many of these therapies are free of charge. My advice to anyone wanting to understand and learn more about complementary therapies is to come to Kampung Senang Member’s Day. I would recommend people looking to manage chronic conditions to become a member and take advantage of the resources and therapies in Kampung Senang.Foo Sey Thong, Cancer SurvivorSHARING KEY TO LEARNINGA willingness by the participants (at the retreat) to share selflessly of their experiences and reflections was very useful and helped to shorten my learning curve in understanding detox, emotional control, and mindfulness.

We are very happy with the school and teachers.Mdm Diana Chai, on the meaningful and unforgettable experience during WCNC’s Graduation ConcertWe attended the “Arts Appreciation in Early Childhood Education” workshop.

However, some parts are not reusable and need new to function.﻿Our sustainability is fully dependent on the kindness of people.

Society for WINGS,"Embracing Life Transitions, Rising above the Challenges","Women hold up half the sky as the saying goes. This is so true as many continue to carry the burden of caregiving even as they age. And yet women are more vulnerable than men as they live longer by an average of 4 years, often beset with physical ailments, face social isolation and financial insecurities. WINGS support women by building an eco-system of empowering women age 40 and above with knowledge and life skills to age well. They are then provided with a platform to provide peer support through special interest groups and volunteer activities that help others embrace life transitions and rise above challenges. WINGS Women-on-the-go, are women who intentionally support others in the community. One example is our Legacy of Love project, where WINGS Senior Digital Ambassadors apply their digital knowledge by helping other women, residents of homes and hospices leave lasting memories for future generations through the production of personal legacy videos. Another soon to be launched project, Bucket of Love will see WINGS Sewing Bees volunteers sew bucket hats for the 1,000 plus women stricken with cancer yearly. These hats help uplift their spirit and keep the dignity of women as they undergo the painful and unpleasant chemotherapy treatment. Our Joyful Singers bring cheer to residents in Homes whilst our balloon sculptors help seniors work their joints by improving mobility and dexterity through the art of sculpting balloons."

Allkin Singapore Ltd.,Unlock opportunities for disadvantaged students to succeed,"People often say that hard work is the key to success. But we often forget that the roads leading to it are not all paved the same.In the wake of Covid-19 and other unforeseen circumstances such as critical illness or death, an increasing number of students from low-income households have little choice but to give up their tertiary education to reduce their families’ financial burdens, cutting short their goals and dreams.This is a struggle that the Liang family understood well. Unlike many of their peers, the four siblings struggled to build a comfortable life amid their family’s financial difficulties.Determined to provide others like themselves with opportunities to succeed, the siblings committed a sum to support disadvantaged students to pursue their academic endeavours and break out of poverty.AMKFSC’s Post-Secondary Education Fund continues the siblings’ legacy by helping our post-secondary student beneficiaries complete their academy journeys, thereby opening doors to better career prospects that bring social mobility within their reach.By offsetting a significant portion of school fees and other relevant and necessary costs, the Fund enables deserving students from low-income families to focus on what matters most: their education. Your generous contribution will not only provide disadvantaged students with a stronger academic foundation but unlock new opportunities for them to pursue a brighter future - both for themselves and their families. "

Allkin Singapore Ltd.,Support Our Community In Need,"As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve, members of the community play an increasingly important role in bringing hope to vulnerable and isolated residents who may otherwise fall through the cracks. The four individuals above - Fazeli, Mdm Suriah, Mdm Rani and Ah Tham - are testament to this. ﻿While these four individuals come from different walks of life, they all have one thing in common - they are residents who are passionate about helping others in the community because of the support they once received. But they can't do it alone. That's why AMKFSC Community Services is appealing for your generous donation - to ensure that our community-based initiatives and hubs can continue to empower everyday individuals with the spaces, resources, and tools to support other vulnerable residents - physically, mentally and emotionally.In doing so, we hope to build more resilient communities that ensure at-risk groups in the community are not forgotten or left behind during this crucial period.If you'd like to play a part in inspiring more community advocates, donate to support them today! "
Allkin Singapore Ltd.,Help children from low-income families like Marcus fulfil their potential! ,"Contrary to popular belief, it's not easy being a kid these days. Imagine growing up in a pandemic-ridden world so different from what we once knew – one where new opportunities are immensely hard to come by, especially without the right support.  Unfortunately, children from low-income families – such as our students at Spright Academy – are the hardest hit. Many of them lack academic, social, or financial support at home, and the Covid-19 pandemic has only made things worse.  Many of their parents have lost their jobs and livelihoods, causing widespread financial insecurity and socio-emotional problems. The shift to home-based learning has also caused these children to fall behind or miss out on learning opportunities due to lack of access to learning tools and digital resources. While some may scoff at “kids these days” for being too soft, too out-of-touch, or simply just too hard to understand, we believe that these children have the adaptability, resilience, and creativity to realise their potential and be more than what society perceives them to be. That’s why #KidsTheseDays, our hope-raising campaign, aims to rally contributions towards Spright Academy’s efforts to provide children from vulnerable backgrounds with a safe, caring and conducive environment, supporting their social, emotional, physical and intellectual development through specially-curated programmes and initiatives.With your support, we can continue to bring hope to low-income children – so that #KidsTheseDays can live up to their fullest potential, no matter what!"

Jesus, the Emmanuel, had a great love and compassion for the poor. He lived among them, cared for them, and reminded them of their dignity in a society that shunned them. His mission on earth was to transform the lives of those He touched, and many became completely different persons after encountering Him. Our Mother Foundress, St Magdalene of Canossa was inspired by the love of Jesus and identified education as the means to transform the lives of the poor in Italy. 200 years later and half a world away from Italy, her mission is still alive and being carried out here in Singapore.Canossaville Children and Community Services (Canossaville) is a Catholic social service agency founded by the Canossian Sisters in 1941.

In this time of social distancing due to the pandemic, technology has enabled us to continue serving our beneficiaries effectively. Recognising an ever increasing need for technology, all proceeds from this campaign will go towards the Canossaville Digital Fund, which is designated towards the purchase of digital equipment and their accompanying accessories and applications. Specific for our children with hearing loss, the fund will also be used for audio and equipment needs that support assessment and intervention.Help us to bring the love and joy of Christ to all this Christmas!

Free Food For All Limited,Thank You For Helping Us Feed Them,"One protein. Two vegetables.For many of these older folks hidden within our neighbourhoods, a bowl of rice and vegetables is considered a luxurious meal to them.Which is why, I think you can begin to imagine the smile shooting across their faces whenever they receive a warm packet of rice with one protein and two vegetables from the team at FREE FOOD FOR ALL.This heart-warming team of individuals have dedicated their time and resources to buy ingredients, cook, pack, and deliver them to the often neglected less fortunate individuals living here in Singapore.Poor souls who have been abandoned (or discarded) by their friends and family.Many of which are barely scrapping by on social assistance and their depleted savings.That's why FREE FOOD FOR ALL has been working hard over the last few years to give these folks something decent. Something tasty. Something warm.A simple meal consisting of rice with one protein and two vegetables.Sure, this might not seem like much to most of us… but to them, it is easily the best meal they have had all week.After all… it definitely beats nibbling on biscuits, buns, and almost expired food cans. But that's all they have to fight against the dreadful feeling of hunger lingering amidst their empty bellies.But that's where you can make a difference!You see, unfortunately, recruiting volunteers to prepare, cook, and deliver food just isn't enough. At least not with the escalating cost of living in Singapore.Ingredients cost money. The brown paper packaging costs money. And the entire delivery process costs money.Worse… it quickly adds up and very soon, their noble deed becomes an expensive affair.Instead with your help, we can help the team at FREE FOOD FOR ALL, persevere in their mission and perhaps do much more.All we're asking for is a small donation of $3.50 or any amount you're comfortable donating. Because with your generousity, we can buy at least one of them a decent dinner this evening.It may seem like a meagre thing to us, but this small act means the world to them…A rewarding meal packed with one protein and two vegetables.So, on behalf of the team, we thank you for your generous contribution, and for helping to feed these poor souls today.The Team Behind Free Food for All (FFFA)FREE FOOD FOR ALL was launched on 4 Nov 2014 when they started to distribute food twice weekly at the Darul Aman Mosque. Their first distribution consisted of 200 packets of nasi lemak, 200 pcs of otah and 40 kg of bananas. This effort soon spread to other communities in various parts of Singapore.Within three months of their first distribution, FREE FOOD FOR ALL Limited was incorporated (4 Feb 2015), and two months later, they obtained their charity status on 11 Jun 2015.Today FREE FOOD FOR ALL delivers an average of 500 free meals every day across the entire spectrum of communities in Singapore."
Free Food For All Limited,Dates For You - A Ramadan Campaign by FFFA,"Part of The Free Food For All mission is to minimize food insecurity and food wastage. Migrant workers are part and parcel of who we serveThis Ramadan FFFA will offer dates to help not just Muslims break fast but all who wish to be a part of this event. FFFA doesn't discriminate between races, faiths and nationalities.We hope this sense of togetherness by FREE FOOD FOR ALL will filter down. No one should celebrate any festive season by themselves.We trust the taste of dates is a sweet and nutritious beginning that leads into the iftar proper."
Free Food For All Limited,Ramadan - A Lesson in Compassion,"About this CampaignRamadan is a very important time of the year for Muslims. It falls on the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, and is probably the most religiously significant time of year for Muslims all over the world.During Ramadan, Muslims fast, pray, and reflect. During this month-long period, they refrain from eating any food or drinking any liquids from sunrise to sunset. They also abstain from thoughts and behavior which are considered to be impure under the teachings of Islam. Muslims believe that the spiritual rewards for these good behaviors are magnified during Ramadan. This mental and physical abstinence is truly a test of endurance, willpower, and discipline.The act of fasting serves two main purposes. Spiritually and religiously, it helps to remind one of their human, mortal vulnerabilities, as well as their reliance on a higher power for sustenance. Socially, it gives one perspective on how it feels to be hungry and thirsty, so they can feel compassion for the needy and less fortunate in our communities. Whatever religious school of thought you subscribe to, or even for those of amongst us who are atheists, this lesson of compassion and empathy for our fellow human beings is one that we can all surely relate to.This Ramadan, Free Food For All has kickstarted an initiative called Ramadan RTE Meals 2019. FFFA will be raising funds to provide the needy with RTE meals over this period. RTE stands for ""Ready to Eat"", and there's a very practical reason behind this decision. RTE meals have a longer shelf life, and can be delivered in bulk. This reduces unnecessary wastage of food, as well as cuts down on resources that would otherwise be required to deliver fresh food to beneficiaries. These tasty meals are simple to prepare, and are the perfect solution for a quick and easy meal, and can be consumed either for Iftar (sunset meal) or Sahoor (sunrise meal).How You Can HelpEach RTE meal pouch is priced at approximately SGD3.50, and beneficiaries will be delivered a carton of 36 meal pouches. These meals will serve to supplement their daily food requirements for the month of Ramadan.3 dollars may not sound like very much money to you or me. To someone else, it may mean the difference between having a warm meal on the table and going hungry. For this campaign, the beneficiaries will be those with low-income staying in rental HDBs, the elderly, as well as those amongst us who have little or no support from their families.﻿As always, any donation amount is greatly appreciated. Your generosity will go a long way in helping provide beneficiaries with a nutritious, palatable, and convenient meal. Each beneficiary will receive a carton of 36 meals, which costs SGD128 each, inclusive of the cost of delivery.Remember, every drop counts."
Free Food For All Limited,Monthly Groceries for Cancer-Stricken Families,"The story of Mdm Noor Hasnah Adam is not one of defeat, nor is it one of surrender.

Free Food For All Limited,Madam Tan saved her granddaughter from child abuse. Will you help them?,"Madam Tan has been a longtime friend of mine since we connected online a few years ago. Sometime last year, she shared with me that her baby granddaughter, Min Min (not her real name), was hospitalized because her father had broken the bones of her little arms. Since she was born, Min Min’s father would beat her whenever he was stressed, leaving her with bruises and red finger marks all over her face and body. Each time, Madam Tan’s daughter, Min Min’s mother, dismissed his actions due to her lack of interest.   As Madam Tan had not been living with them, she was unaware that this situation was happening. However, the abuse went too far this time, and the parents had no choice but to bring Min Min to the hospital. This was when Madam Tan was called down after the police were notified of suspected child abuse and saw what had happened. At this point, Madam Tan wanted to take Min Min back where she would be safe, but she was sent back to her parents as the case was still under investigation. As a grandmother, it was her worst nightmare. And then the abuse happened again.  This time round, the police granted Min Min child protection, leaving her in the care of Madam Tan. However, Madam Tan does not earn much and so taking care of Min Min puts a strain on her finances. She used to run a stall in the market duplicating keys which provided her just enough for herself. However, now that she had to take care of Min Min, she is unable to work and make ends meet. When I heard of this, I just knew I had to do something. Currently, Madam Tan told me she needs help with the following expenses: Gas - $34 per can (40 days)HDB rental $99 per monthElectricity $150 per monthTown council $21 per month (owe $270)Pigeon Wet tissue x 2 per monthCerelac 2 box per week Milk powder 1 can per weekPampers 1 pack per weekRice, fish and meat, potatoes for porridge every day In total, this adds up to about $500/month. Although the parents sometimes give Madam Tan money, they are not enough and inconsistent. As a result, Madam Tan has had to use her savings and now, they are almost gone. To get by, she eats maggie noodles and goes to her friend’s stall for dinner so that she can save money for Min Min’s milk powder and pampers. Through Deeda, I managed to get in touch with Nizar from Free Food for All (FFFA), who kindly sponsored Madam Tan and Min Min with three months’ worth of diapers, milk powder and the food they need for basic living.However, they still need help with their outstanding Gas, Electricity, Town Council and Rental expenses. If you could be a kind soul to lend Madam Tan a helping hand and raise Min Min to have a bright future that she deserves, please donate to this fundraising page I have set-up for her with FFFA. All the funds will go towards covering their essential expenses listed above for the next one year.Madam Tan only wishes for her to grow up safe and healthy. She also takes care of blind and paralysed cats in their a 1-room rental flat but the grandfather is no longer around, so they need people like you to look out for them. No amount is too small. Even $10 will ensure they have enough food for 2 days. Thank you so much. Yours Sincerely,Pamela Lim Madam Tan’s case is something you do not often hear about in Singapore. They are currently in a complex situation where they are unable to get other sources of government funding. Currently, the Ministry of Social and Family Affairs is looking to provide childcare for the baby, so that the grandmother can work, but in the meantime, they need help covering basic necessities and expenses. At the moment, Free Food for All has provided them with food, rations, milk powder and diapers to last them for the next 3 months. However, as we do not receive any grants from the government or any organizations and rely solely on donations to fund our programs, we are hoping to raise funds to ensure their every need is cared for. With the help of our volunteers, we will ensure the money goes to where Madam Tan and the baby need it most and for every month. As such, we greatly appreciate any support you could give to Madam Tan and her granddaughter. -Nizar Shariff, Founder of Free Food for All About Free Food for All (FFFA)Free Food for All is a registered charity in Singapore which provides free meals to the less fortunate regardless races or religion. Our mission is to provide free food to the needy so as to empower them to become contributing members of society.

This event saw people from all walks of life coming together to help others in their community.                  This was followed by the launch of the Ready-to-cook chicken vending machine in Yishun on 5 November 2022. Through the launch of this Ready-to-cook chicken vending machine, it provides easy access to ready-to-cook food items, so as to mitigate rising cost of food (especially proteins). Moreover, those registered beneficiaries would be able to have access to chicken, on top of the fresh produce from their community fridge.                         FFFA recently concluded on 12 November 2022 the distribution of 10,000 plant-based meals as part of its #spreadkindfood campaign for World Kindness Day this year. These plant-based meals were given to various agencies and community groups to express kindness and appreciation for the work they do- to make Singapore a better place to live in.

Action For Singapore Dogs Society,Lonzo Lives To Fight Another Day,"Update - 31 July’19Thank you all for your kind and generous support!As you can see from the pictures, Lonzo‘s joyous spirit has been brought back to life!:) He is very well taken care of by 2 sets of fosterers who take turns to look after him when the other party travels. They frequently bring him for physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and acupuncture sessions.However, Lonzo has not managed to regain his mobility yet. We are still optimistic that Lonzo might walk again one day and so we require additional funds to pay for his rehabilitation sessions. Moreover, we have only reach half of our goal of defraying Lonzo’s $9000 initial medical expenses.If you would like to help Lonzo in his journey toward recovery, please kindly make a donation in the button below. Any contribution is much appreciated!Story﻿The trailer struck and flung him into a drain several metres away. Yet, he survived the impact. ﻿He was unable to move in the drain which was half-filled with water. Yet, he did not drown.""He's not ready to go yet."" That's what everyone who has met him so far says. Although the boy is not able to move his hind legs and the pain he's in must be excruciating, you can still see the life in his eyes burning bright; you can still see the will to survive in him. We have christened him Lonzo, a Spanish name meaning ""ready for battle"" because he clearly is not going to go down without a fight. The horrific accident took place last year in Jalan Lekar. Workers saw a trailer hitting and flinging the harmless stray into the air and then into the ditch. Thank goodness a kind soul who heard about the accident from the witnesses acted quickly by rushing to the scene and reaching out to us. Lonzo was immediately transported to the vet where x-rays showed a very severe injury - spinal fracture/luxation. ﻿With the first round of fundraising, we operated on the spine to stabilise it and get rid of the severe pain that is tormenting Lonzo. Thesurgery went well and after 2 weeks of hospitalisation, he was discharged into the care of fosterer extraordinaire Puay San who had earlier nursed another paralysed dog Teddy back to health and on his feet again!The vets are optimistic about Lonzo and there is a possibility that he might be able to walk again one day! This would be a dream come true if it does happen but we don't want to get our hopes up too much. We are already beyond happy that his spine has been stabilised and he is pain free.Lonzo will be undergoing physiotherapy and hydrotherapy and he has already been gifted with a wheelchair courtesy of kind sponsor Ewan Kuah.Lonzo is indeed a lucky boy to have so many guardian angels, from his rescuer Karen to all the staff at the vets he went to and of course his fosterer Puay San!﻿His medical expenses - initially estimated to be around $8,000 - $8,500 - eventually hit $9,000 as he was hospitalised longer than expected. We have not managed to raise enough funds to cover his bill yet so we hope that you too can be an angel and help contribute to make Lonzo's life a better one."
Action For Singapore Dogs Society,Help These Dogs Find A Forever Home,"They may not be purebred, but these dogs are just as worthy of your love.Singapore has an estimated population of 10000 stray dogs. Out on the streets, these strays survive in harsh and difficult conditions, and are constantly at risk of injury from traffic, starvation and disease. Their lives are a daily struggle; a far cry from the many lucky dogs who have been fortunate enough to have a loving home.This is where Action for Singapore Dogs (ASD) comes in. Established in 2000, they are considered one of the most active dog welfare groups in Singapore. ASD’s mission is to improve the welfare of stray and abandoned dogs in Singapore, with a strict no-kill policy.How your contribution can helpIn order to provide a loving home for these dogs, ASD established the ASD Adoption & Rescue Centre (ARC) in 2007 to provide a safe and stable sanctuary for the many sick and injured dogs to recover fully before finding their forever home. The ARC currently houses 100 dogs. A conservative estimate of maintaining a rescued dog at a shelter is $200 per month. This includes the basic necessities of food, boarding, and tick, flea and heartworm prevention. As ASD is a non-profit organization, a substantial amount of monetary and manpower resources are required to keep the facility running smoothly day to day.Thus, if you believe in ASD’s cause and would like to support them in their tireless (and often thankless) endeavour, do consider making a donation to help out. Your generosity will go a long way. "
Action For Singapore Dogs Society,Let's Create Hope for Zeus,"Update - 25 June’19We had a nail biting 2 weeks after Zeus’ surgery as his condition was so touch-and-go. We were elated when the vet finally gave the green light for him to go home. We were fortunate that an experienced fosterer stepped up to the plate and offered to care for Zeus after his discharge. We are pleased to update that Zeus is doing well since his discharge and has regained his appetite. He enjoys outings to the dog run, although he does tire easily. Once again, we would like to thank everyone for their support in our time of need. ASD has been hit by 2 big medical bills recently. Besides Zeus, there’s another dog under our care at our Adoption and Rescue Centre(ARC) named Kangaroo who has also been undergoing medical treatment. In total, the medical bill has accumulated to a heartstopping total of $12,504.80. Thanks to our generous donors, we were able to provide our 2 beloved dogs with the medical care which they required. However, due to the medical bills for Zeus and Kangaroo being higher than anticipated, we will be continuing to fundraise to defray the costs.Update - 9 June’19Zeus’ surgery for his twisted stomach was more than a week ago but though his condition is now stable, his recovery is slower than we hope. He still refuses to eat on his own and has to be syringe fed and there is minimal gut movement.In addition his protein level is low so there is fluid build up in his legs and his red blood cell count is also rather low. The vet has warned us that if it drops any lower, he may need a blood transfusion.The good news is that he likes to taken out of his cage to be walked and looks forward to the volunteers’ visits.We will update again in a few days' time hopefully with better news. In the meantime, please continue to include him in your thoughts and prayers.As we don’t know when he will be discharged, the hospitalisation cost is looking very daunting. We currently also have another ARC dog Kangaroo (who is handicapped and has deformed front paws) hospitalised at the same vet for gastroenteritis so this is a double blow to us.If you can help to contribute towards Zeus' and Kangaroo’s medical expenses, that would be very much appreciated.Update - 31 May’19Thank you for the amazing outpouring of love, support and encouragement for Zeus! We are overwhelmed by everyone’s kindness and thoughtfulness. One of our donors who is a reiki practitioner even performed a distant reiki healing session to aid in his recovery.Zeus came out alive after his 2.5 hr surgery but is still in critical condition. His stomach was very badly twisted and was leaking gastric juice all over the place resulting in several of his organs being badly infected.The vet had to remove a quarter of his stomach as well as his spleen and the stomach had to be stapled to the abdominal wall. Because of the severe infection, Zeus needs to be on a high dose of antibiotics. Some dogs may not survive this so we are all hoping and praying for the best.This morning he was alert and started standing and walking around in his cage. He still cannot eat on his own so he needs to be syringe fed.Zeus’ prognosis is guarded and we have been advised to take things 1 day at a time. Please continue keeping him in your thoughts and prayers as he is not out of the woods yet.Since Zeus is not expected to be discharged so soon, we appeal to you to help defray his vet bills by making a small donation.Story﻿Zeus, one of our beloved ARC (Adoption and Rescue Centre) residents was rushed to the vet this morning when he started vomiting blood and had severe diarrhea at the same time.Ultrasound and x-rays showed that his stomach was twisted, a clear sign of the dreaded life threatening condition known as gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) or bloat.The vet advised either an emergency surgery or putting Zeus down as he is in agonising pain. We of course opted for the surgery. However as Zeus is already 12 years old, this would be a very risky procedure and he may not make it out alive. In his prime, Zeus was a blood donor and has saved the lives of many dogs. We owe it to him to try to save his life now. Please include him in your thoughts and prayers. ﻿We desperately want Zeus to pull through and so does his mother Mommy Girl who is anxiously waiting back at ARC for his return. The operation alone costs $3,500, not including blood tests, x-rays, ultrasound and hospitalisation. Please make a donation, if you would like to help us with his medical bill. Thank you for helping Zeus!"
Action For Singapore Dogs Society,Let’s Help Winfield Get Better!,"In late June, the Action for Singapore Dogs (ASD) Society rescued Winfield from an industrial area in Woodlands. Winfield was the unfortunate victim of a vicious attack by other dogs over a territorial dispute. The poor boy’s wounds were already festering and teeming with maggots when our volunteer came across him, and quickly secured him to be brought to the vet. Please be warned - the photos below are definitely not for the squeamish.Winfield had wounds and lacerations on his left cheek, neck, ears, nostrils and paw which required daily cleaning and he had to be hospitalised for more than a week. On top of that, he has also been tested positive for heartworm.Winfield has finally been discharged, and the ASD will be sterilising him once he is fully recovered. As he has such a sweet disposition, they will be rehoming him once he has undergone heartworm treatment. As always, your generous donations will go a long way in helping cover the medical expenses of Winfield, as well as other dogs like him who are sick, injured, and in need of medical care. Such bills can be extremely costly, and the ASD is grateful for every single contribution that they receive."
Action For Singapore Dogs Society,Will you be Hero's hero?,"Update - 26 August 2019Thank you all for your outpouring love and support for Hero. Within a few short weeks, we have been able to raise more than $5000 for Hero’s recovery! However, there have been unexpected developments in Hero’s condition.As it turns out, Hero has Cushing’s Disease and needs to be on life-long medication. For a while, we were wondering why his stomach always seemed to be bloated, and his skin lesions were not healing despite the medications we have been giving him.A 1-month supply of his medication costs $125, or $1,500 a year, on top of transportation costs and other expenses.We are currently more than $4000 short of our goal. If would like to help Hero lead a comfortable life that he deserves, please click on the ‘Donate Now’ button below. Any amount is greatly appreciated.As of now, Hero is living with a fosterer. We hope that with proper medication and tender loving care at home, his condition will improve. Please pray for him.Story - 15 July 2019Not all heroes wear capes. That is certainly the case of our recently rescued dog christened “Hero”, by a volunteer after hearing his story. Until recently, Hero was living at a Tuas construction site after being abandoned by his owner many years ago. Last week, however, Hero was involved in an accident. Workers who found him pulled together and brought him to the local vet. Unfortunately, they could not afford to pay for the necessary medical treatment, and resolved to get him euthanised.Nonetheless, fate brought us together as his saving grace.The vet refused to euthanise him. Instead, he contacted us to ask if we were willing to take the poor little dog into our care. Of course, we immediately obliged and gave the vet the go-ahead to proceed with the necessary medical procedures. Photos and videos of him we later received from the vet broke our hearts and convinced us we had made the right choice.﻿A ton of blood work and X-rays later, the results for Hero were surprisingly not as bad as we had expected. The X-rays showed no fractures or dislocations in the limbs, hip or spine and there were also no signs of bladder rupture or haemorrhaging in his chest cavity. His kidneys are fine and he has no tick fever or heartworm.However, owing to years of neglect, Hero suffers from a multitude of infections (Demodex mite infection, secondary bacterial and yeast infections) that left him bald with sores all over and with paws red and raw. His condition is so bad that we cannot even tell what breed Hero is (though we suspect he could be a Maltese cross). He was also found to have a yeast infection in both ears, and the scarring of both corneas. Moreover, Hero has some weakness in his hind limbs, and delayed to absent conscious proprioception, possibly linked to a spinal or nerve injury. As he is currently able to walk however, the vet advised us to just monitor the situation for now instead of rushing to do costly CT scans or specialist surgery.Hero’s initial check-up and X-rays have cost us close to $700, and we are likely to spend more in the coming months to continue treating his skin condition. And if Hero shows signs of pain or has difficulty walking, we may have to bring him for a CT scan which costs a few thousand dollars.Despite all this, Hero continues to maintain a sweet and affectionate disposition which inspired our volunteer to name him “Hero”.

Action For Singapore Dogs Society,Our 6 Rescued Dogs Need Your Support,"Joy, elation, jubilation, euphoria… these words can be used to describe how we felt when we finally managed to secure the wounded female dog, “Baby”, whom we have been tracking ever since we were sent some horrifying photos of her injuries late Monday night.This was the photo a cyclist had sent to us after spotting ‘Baby’ at a secluded area in Chestnut Nature ParkThe next day, one of our volunteers headed down to the area first thing on Tuesday morning to find her, but he was unsuccessful.That evening, another volunteer tried his luck. And he struck gold! He not only managed to locate the pitiful dog, but he also discovered she had a litter of 3 puppies with her. This made the case more complicated than we imagined. As he did have enough manpower with him and the light was failing fast, he assessed it was best that we revisit this case the next day.On Wednesday morning, a small team of our volunteers arrived at Chestnut Nature Park with trapping equipment. The closest available car park was at a HDB in Bukit Panjang, more than 1km away. From there, we hiked into the forest. It was a bit of a trek in, but luckily our perseverance paid off when “Baby” appeared in our midst. Baby lying down some distance away during one of our recces We got to work in coming up with a plan to trap her. However, we realised that the task ahead was not going to be easy. None of our usual trapping methods would work in the heavily wooded environment, and she was wary of our presence. She barked at us and kept her distance while we fed and played with her puppies. At one point, she even bolted when one of our volunteers stretched out his hand towards her. While we were there, we also found 2 other adults dogs living in the area, though similarly as wary.  We stayed for a total of 2 hours exploring the surroundings and brainstorming the best approach to trap them. During this time, we noticed empty food and water containers strewn on the forest bed and surmised that this pack had a regular feeder. In the end, we figured it would be best to locate the feeder whom we hope the dogs trusted enough to approach. Another difficulty was getting the dog(s) back to our vehicles at Bukit Panjang. It would be an arduous undertaking to carry several heavy crates over such a distance and on such an undulating terrain. We then decided to contact the National Parks Board (NPark) to seek permission to drive a vehicle in and transport the dogs out once we had trapped them. However, they told us that we had to give them at least 3 days advance notice before we could do so. In the meantime, we desperately tried to locate the feeder by reaching out to all our contacts. Once again, we got lucky. A feeder from another location had her contact and passed us her number! One of our volunteers, Fanzhe, decided to meet her and ask for her help in executing the plan the next morning. It was providence that all 3 dogs appeared when Fanzhe and the feeder went into the forest. As we had suspected, the dogs greeted her familiar face with waggy tails. Getting the injured dog medical treatment was the top priority. As such, Fanzhe decided to seize the opportunity and secured her with the help of the feeder. He also proceeded to gather the pups, as he did not want them to be left behind without their mother. Not wanting to waste any more time waiting for NPark’s approval, Fanzhe placed the heavy crates on a trolley and push them all the way back to the carpark, carefully avoiding rocks and tree roots along the way. Thereafter, he went back up again to secure the other 2 adult dogs for sterilisation and medical check-up. Present SituationThe injured dog has been affectionately christened Baby by the feeder whom she has been feeding for around 10 years together with the other 2 adults: Laokow (male) and Lucky (female). We have also named Baby’s 3 pups Chevy (male), Chaz (male) and Carly (female). The whole pack is now safe at our kennels.LaokowLuckyBaby's adorable pups (from left to right): Chevy, Chaz and CarlyBaby has since been treated for her wound at the vet. Both her and Laokow have also been diagnosed with heartworm disease. We have since started them on the necessary treatment. ﻿Baby happy and relieved to finally get her wound treatedWe further intend to sterilise her and the other 2 other dogs and assess if they can be rehomed. However, we have been informed by NParks that we would not be allowed to release them back at Chestnut Nature Park. We are very disappointed with this stance. From our experience, the puppies can be re-homed, but it would be difficult to do the same for adult dogs. As much as we would like adult strays like Baby, Laohow and Lucky to go into homes, they may be too feral. Hence, the only alternative would be to release them back to their habitat, instead of letting them languish away in a kennel. After enjoying years of freedom, kennels would be perceived as a prison cell to them. When the 5-year nationwide trap-neuter-release-manage (TNRM) was launched in November 2018 to humanely reduce the stray dog population, we were overjoyed. To show our commitment, we have been actively trapping and sterilising strays since the start of the programme. To date, we have already trapped more than 170 strays and rehomed almost 50% of them. However, we also have had to release many dogs back to their original habitat, especially when we do not have the space or the resources to house them for the rest of their lives. Not having this option weighs heavily on us. How You Can HelpThe upfront expenditure for each TNRM dog can amount to $350 or more. This equates to more than $10,800 to take care of Baby, Laokow and Lucky for the rest of their lives. Although the Animal & Veterinary Service (AVS) will reimburse us for the cost of sterilisation and some other medical procedures, we still have other expenses to bear, namely transportation, trapping equipment, and medical treatment and boarding for sick or injured dogs. Baby, Laokow and Lucky costs will be substantially higher as we needed to treat Baby's injuries and provide long-term medication for her heartworm disease along with Laokow. Furthermore, we now have to bear their food and boarding expenses indefinitely. These expenses are not reimbursed by AVS.  Hence, if you would like to support our efforts, please click on the ‘Donate Now’ button below to make a donation. Any amount is greatly appreciated.Thank you in advance for your kindness and generosity. As always, 100% of your donation made on Deeda will go directly to ASD. We do not take any fees. "
Action For Singapore Dogs Society,Please Help To Save Rudolf's Leg,"One night shortly after Christmas, Action for Singapore Dogs (Singapore) received an urgent SOS from a feeder. A dog had been found lying in a remote area with a broken leg. A volunteer headed down at 11pm to look for it and managed to spot it from a distance but the frightened stray hobbled away when the torchlight was shone on him.  The volunteer decided to return the next day with reinforcements and fortunately managed to secure the injured dog with the help of another volunteer. The dog turned out to be a young, handsome and friendly boy whom we decided to name Rudolf as we were still in the Christmas mood. X-rays show that he sustained a particularly nasty fracture on his left hind leg. We were also surprised to learn that the injury was several weeks old and that it would be quite difficult to operate now.  The vet suggested amputation as an option. However, we were not keen to do that when we discovered that his right hind leg showed signs of early hip dysplasia. After consultation with a specialist, we decided to go ahead with the surgery to repair Rudolf's left hind leg so that he would not be a cripple in future. We have been quoted around $3,800 for the surgery. We appeal to you, our kind friends and supporters to help us save Rudolf's leg by clicking on the ""Donate Now"" Button.Any amount is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your kindness and generosity. "
Oasis Second Chance Animal Shelter Ltd,Save Tian Tian from Maggot Infestation,"Update -13 Oct'19Dearest donors,Thank you for your support for Tian Tian!She doing very well. In fact, her wound is almost fully healed now. She currently stays in a foster home where her foster parents are looking to adopt her.Tian Tian says, ""thank you for caring for me"".StoryAlone with a massive maggot-infested wound on her back, Tian Tian looked scared when feeders in Sembawang found her.Her wound was deep and gaping, spanning almost the entire width of her back. Maggots were infesting all around it, and the surrounding skin tissues were turning black. The feeders knew at that point she needed immediate medical attention and rushed her to the vet.Tian Tian’s wound has since been thoroughly cleaned and treated. However, she still needs to be monitored closely at the vet for at least another week for professional medical care and ensure the infection does not recur. She also requires treatment for Anemia, alongside a very high white blood cell count. Our vet bills are stacking up, but this rescue was critical. It will take some time for her wound to completely heal, and Tian Tian’s bills are estimated to be around $3,000. Any help we can get for them would be greatly appreciated.  Click on the ‘Donate Now’ button below to help. Let us bring Tian Tian back to good health as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your generosity!"
Oasis Second Chance Animal Shelter Ltd,Tick fever is killing our Lammy. Will you help rescue him?,"Update - 9 October'19Lammy has since passed.He had been hospitalised for the past 3 weeks until Oasis Second Chance Animal Shelter (OSCAS) decided to bring him back for home management.Despite two rounds of blood transfusion and immune system treatment at the hospital, Lammy's condition yoyo-ed with no sign of long-term improvement. While his appetite was good, he was still anaemic with signs of a declining liver function. Lammy's medical bills have cost us around $8,000, but it never crossed our minds to give him less of a fighting chance.Every day, we take care of many sick dogs just like Lammy. Could you help us, so that we can continue to give them a fighting chance?StoryIn the blink of an eye, our Lammy went from his usual curious 5-year self patrolling around his kennel, to one who is in the hospital fighting for his life.All this started last Wednesday when our volunteers discovered him suddenly looking lethargic with near-white gums, a sign of severe anaemia. Immediately, we rushed him to the vet to get him treated.The blood test results were frightening. The average platelet count for a healthy dog lies in the range of 148-484 Kμ/L, but Lammy’s was zero. The cause of this is Ehrlichia, a strain of tick fever, which doesn't usually result in severe clinical signs. In spite of the emergency blood transfusion the vet gave him, his immune system has not picked up. The worry now is that the tick fever has affected his bone marrow, the site of blood platelet production. Therefore, he will remain in hospital for observation and treatment until his condition improves.Our little Lammy is a fighter. We are doing all we can to rescue him, but his medical bills will cost us at least $5k. Will you help us?"
Oasis Second Chance Animal Shelter Ltd,Help Phoenix Walk Again!,"HELP PHOENIX WALK AGAIN!Three-year-old Phoenix has spent his life so far in a wheelchair. With promising signs of improvement and his whole life ahead of him, Phoenix could be wheelchair-free! However, he needs your help.The next step he needs is to surgically fix his right hip, which is dislocated and hinders any progress due to the pain he endures.Spunky Phoenix requires a hip surgery costing around SGD$3,700 followed by a three-month rehabilitation treatment plan costing SGD$2,100 monthly. In addition, SGD$2,500 to help cover medications and transport costs.With this financial support and the support of his long-term fosterer, within 3 months we expect to see further improvement in his mobility and a new lease on life!PHOENIX'S STORYPhoenix was found at 6 weeks old with a severe spinal injury, likely the result of being hit by someone with something and then left for dead. Fortunately, he was found by a kind lady who brought him to the vet. He had open wounds on his body covered in maggots and was barely a skeleton. After two weeks of intensive vet care he was placed in foster care. His recovery started well and he even began to walk, however, the spinal injury was too severe and after a few months, he lost the use of his hind legs.Surgery to try stabilise his spine was the only option which he underwent in October 2017. Since then his recovery has been slow due to nerve damage, but he is a little fighter and with acupuncture, hydrotherapy and homeopathic medicine he has steadily improved! He is now at a stage, where he has pain sensation in his hind legs and showing some control of movement.Once his hip has been corrected, a comprehensive treatment plan will follow, working with an experienced rehab vet including laser treatment to help restore nerve function, acupuncture, hydrotherapy and physiotherapy at least 3 times a week.Thank you for your support to give Phoenix the life he deserves!TO DONATETo donate to help us raise $12,500 to help Phoenix walk again:1) Bank Transfer or Cheque*Name of Account: OSCAS LtdBank Account: DBS (Current) 048-904283-4Transaction Ref: Your Name - Phoenix2) PayNow*UEN No.: 201406657D (Transaction Ref: Phoenix & your name)3) PayPalpaypal.me/oscasAccount: donate@oscas.sg * Please drop us an email at finance@oscas.sg if you require a receipt acknowledging your donation."

Assisi Hospice,Support us as we meet patients’ needs at their end-of-life,"67 year-old Mr Tan* was diagnosed with a rare tumour behind his abdominal area (retroperitoneal liposarcoma), and was admitted to Assisi Hospice in Jun 2023. He had been divorced for over 20 years, and was working as a cleaner and staying in a 1-room rental flat before admission. When he came under our care, he expressed his wish to reconnect with his ex-wife Li Shan* and his only son.Our Clinical Pastoral Care staff managed to reach out to Li Shan through their church pastor. As she shared with our social worker Calista about the circumstances she faced leading up to the divorce, she broke down and cried. Mr Tan struggled with gambling and substance abuse, which eventually led to her leaving the marriage in the interest of their child.“I came because I want to tell him that I forgive him, “Li Shan shared with Calista. “But I don’t know why I cannot bring myself to go into the room.” Calista listened patiently and offered Li Shan the emotional support she needed. With her company, Li Shan mustered up her courage and went into Mr Tan’s room. When they saw each other, they started to sob. After a long while, he finally mustered up enough strength for the two words, in between sobs - “I’m sorry”. Still in tears, she replied softly, “I forgive you. You can go in peace.”After that day, Li Shan continued to visit. Mr Tan deteriorated rapidly, and passed on peacefully in July 2023. Our volunteers from the No One Dies Alone programme supported the family by keeping vigil at Mr Tan’s side during his final moments. In addition to Assisi’s substantial subsidies supported by donations, our social worker also helped to apply for Medifund to pay for his medical bill, and arranged a pro bono funeral for him.At Assisi Hospice, our patients come to us not only for medical care. Many times, there are other wounds and needs. Support our work as we strive to meet our patients’ needs at the most vulnerable time in their lives.*Names have been changed"

The Singapore Association for the Deaf,Empower Children Like Wen Xi with Early Intervention and Essential Assistance #SADeaf68th,"Meet Wen Xi, a spirited 8-year-old girl born with a unique set of challenges including a single kidney, hearing loss, deformed fingers, and the rare Fanconi Anemia - a bone marrow disorder. Much smaller in size for her age due to her medical conditions, she has undergone bone marrow transplant and requires frequent hospital visits for treatment of her various medical conditions and requires assistance for movement and transportation.Yet, amidst these hurdles, Wen Xi has found a haven of hope when her mother brought her to The Little Hands Bilingual Bicultural Programme, an early intervention project run by The Singapore Association for the Deaf (SADeaf). Despite her adversities, she continues to find joy in painting, art, and reading, immersing herself in phonics, English, and maths classes, while eagerly participating in speech and drama activities. On top of these, she also receives art therapy and learns Singapore Sign Language.Her boundless enthusiasm for learning and SADeaf’s social engagement activities help her explore new horizons and broaden her worldview. SADeaf has also helped to seek funding in order to alleviate the family’s financial difficulties and is continuing to support the family’s needs.ABOUT THE LITTLE HANDS BILINGUAL-BICULTURAL PROGRAMMEIn Singapore, Wen Xi is not alone in her struggles. Three in every 1000 babies born in our city-state face significant hearing impairment, potentially delaying their speech, language, intellectual, social, and emotional development. In addition, one or more children out of five with unknown cause of sensorineural hearing loss may have genetic Hearing Loss which is the leading known cause of Hearing Loss currently, more so than infections or injury.This is why The Little Hands Bilingual-Bicultural Programme was established in 2018, to provide young children (usually between the age of 2.5 to 7) with hearing loss, the opportunity to learn through play, using Singapore Sign Language (SgSL).It encompasses a linguistic environment in which the children have the opportunity to develop their linguistics skills (Singapore Sign Language and English), as well as build their cognitive and social-emotional development. The ""bilingualism"" part of the programme refers to the use of both sign language and speech, if the child is able to.Besides learning the Singapore Sign Language (sgSL) used by the deaf community here, art, maths and English (grammar and vocabulary), the children also go through role-playing exercises that build their confidence and acclimatise them to varied social settings where they may or may not be the only one who is deaf, embodying the ""bicultural"" element of our programme.The class is conducted by a trained teacher of the Deaf and a Deaf assistant teacher. The sessions include storytelling, SgsSL lessons, English and Mathematics lessons, art and craft activities, indoor and outdoor play and snack time.It has been 5 years since The Little Hands Bilingual-Bicultural Programme was established and we are heartened by the lives we have touched and empowered. Today, as we celebrate our 68th Anniversary of SADeaf, our mission doesn’t end here and we wish to continue our effort to nurture more “Little Hands” in the future. With your support, we will be able to reach out to more people in the deaf community, continue to make a difference in the lives of those affected by hearing loss through programmes like Little Hands and more, offering them the same opportunity to thrive and reach their fullest potential. Your generosity will help us in creating a society where the deaf have equal opportunities and are not limited by their challenges. Help us transform silence into strength, isolation into inclusion, and fear into fearlessness. Together, let's shape a world of endless possibilities for these extraordinary children and the deaf community.Every donation counts. Your support makes all the difference. Thank you."

"RAINBOW CENTRE, SINGAPORE",CURIO: An Art Fundraiser Showcase,"CURIO is an art fundraiser organised by Rainbow Centre, a charity serving persons with disabilities, showcasing 45 works of art by talented youths who share their perspectives and observations of the world. In a time when open-mindedness is more necessary than ever, this exhibition encourages us to see beyond the familiar and to value curiosity as a catalyst for understanding. Through their art, these youths reveal beauty in diverse perspectives, reminding us that inclusion is the path to a more vibrant, empathetic world. Funds raised from this campaign empower our work through three key areas of needs: Enabling low resource families to access services, reducing caregiver stress and social isolation through services such as special student care and adult community programmes and developing research and innovation driven practices in Rainbow Centre.With dollar-for-dollar matching from the Tote Board, your donation will have double the impact and help build a brighter future for our clients with disabilities. Our budding artists are from RC’s Artability talent development programme for students 15 - 18 years old, who grow their visual art styles through training and opportunities. They are exposed to a variety of art mediums and advocacy opportunities to partake in the local art scene, through learning journeys or exchanges with professional artists or trainers.  As Singapore advances towards a more inclusive society, it is vital for platforms where the public can look beyond disabilities and learn about the individuals behind the ‘special needs’ label. They too have interests, hopes and dreams of a good life. We invite you to experience their work at the CURIO showcase from 5 - 12 Oct and bring along friends and family. Let’s come together to shape a future where inclusion is not just an ideal, but a lived reality for all. For more info, visit rainbowcentre.org.sg/curio2024."

"LOVE, NILS LTD.",Shine a Light - No child should face the nightmare of cancer alone.,"When Jacob* was 5 years old, his mother Sophie noticed he seemed unusually tired and had little appetite. Instead of waiting it out, she trusted her mother's intuition and took him to the pediatrician for a checkup.That decision may have saved Jacob's life.After running some tests, the doctor discovered a large mass in Jacob's abdomen. He was diagnosed with stage 3 neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer. The family's world was shattered.Jacob immediately began an aggressive treatment plan of chemotherapy, radiation, stem cell transplant, and surgery to remove the tumor. The road was long and immensely difficult for such a young child, but his family remained hopeful and positive.Thanks to Sophie's prompt action in getting Jacob checked out at the first signs something was wrong, the cancer was caught relatively early before spreading further. After over a year of grueling treatment, Jacob got the incredible news - he was cancer free.Now a thriving 9-year-old full of energy and life, Jacob loves playing soccer and video games with his friends. His family is forever grateful they didn't delay when Sophie's instincts told her something wasn't right.LOVE , NILS' Shine-A-Light campaign spotlights on why raising awareness for the signs of childhood cancer is so crucial. When caught early, many childhood cancers are very treatable but most parents don't know what to look for.Please give generously and help us shine a light on this important cause. No child should have to face the nightmare of cancer alone. With early detection, we can give them a fighting chance.*name changed"

SOSD ,SOSD Rehabilitation Centre (SRC) 2024,"#Applied for Dollar-for-Dollar Matching Grant by TOTE BoardSOSD is dedicated to the welfare of Singapore's many street dogs. Our shelter exists to rescue, rehabilitate and rehome strays to give them a second chance at life. Over the 11 years, we have rescued and rehomed more than 2,000 dogs.We are currently caring for 200 dogs at The Animal Lodge and Jurong Island shelter and feeding 70 strays in Jurong Island. SOSD is located at The Animal Lodge, where most of Singapore's animal shelters and commercial farms are housed.

Because of you, our team in Jurong Island (JI) is able to continue the Jurong Island project.  Together with Noah's Ark Cares, SOSD runs a Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage programme on JI. We care for 117 dogs in our JI shelter, and feed another 70 strays, feeding the dogs on JI is quite a feat. Due to strict regulations on the island, members of the public are not allowed to feed the stray dogs.

Ascending Hope Community Services Ltd.,Food For Hope 2024 by Ascending Hope,"Dear friends,If you're able to help, let's give assurance to 600 elderly and underprivileged families (in Whampoa, Toa Payoh, and Bishan) with Project #FoodForHope today!Project #FoodForHope, an impactful initiative that seeks to alleviate the plight of 600 elderly and underprivileged families residing in the Whampoa, Toa Payoh, and Bishan areas.It's truly heart-wrenching to think that there are individuals out there who are uncertain about where their next meal will come from. That's why we are dedicated to ensure the food security of these vulnerable families and elderly citizens.Our committed volunteers work tirelessly to:- Sort- Pack, and- Distribute food packs filled with perishable and non-perishable items......Bringing hope and sustenance to those who need it most.Here's how your 250% tax-deductible donation will make a difference:In the past, Food For Hope primarily focused on distributing food rations to support low-income families and the elderly, addressing their fundamental needs for food and daily essentials.However, in 2024, Food For Hope 2024 is expanding its scope to encompass a wider range of services and aims to achieve a higher level of fulfillment for our beneficiaries.The elderly beneficiaries we serve, who live alone, have limited human interactions, physical disabilities or challenges. Food For Hope goes the extra mile by befriending residents that we serve. Sending food and serving a meal provides the connection and the opportunity to check on them and care for their mental well-being.With your help, we aim to provide food rations to approximately 600 isolated elderly and low-income families as well.This is so that children won't have to attend school on an empty stomach, adults with financial challenges can be free from concerns about the next meal for their families, and the elderly are able to get their basic food supply.Lunch VisitationWe carry out about 180 weekly lunch visitations, by delivering meals to senior residents in rental flats and flats situated in Bishan, Toa Payoh, and Whampoa. Going beyond basic assistance, we actively befriend these residents. Many are isolated elderly individuals who may experience loneliness due to a lack of regular social interaction.Food is not only a means of sustenance... it also provides an avenue for expressing care, motivation, love, hospitality, and encouragement.In addition to the meals, we provide a monthly supply of non-perishable food items to further support their needs. This programme aims to alleviate their feelings of isolation, serving as a reminder that they are not forgotten.Makan CircleWe facilitate the bi-monthly ‘makan fellowship’ that creates a community for approximately 200 isolated elderly to leave the confines of their homes to make friends and get the social support they need.Especially during the festive season, these initiatives create moments of joy and warmth. Together through sharing a feast, we aim to uplift moods as we celebrate as a community.Food Ration DistributionOur goal is to extend support to around 600 low-income families and isolated elderly individuals by providing essential food rations.By doing so, we aspire to ensure that children do not attend school on an empty stomach, to relieve the financial worries of adults facing economic challenges by offering them meal support for their families, and to ensure that isolated elderly individuals have access to their basic food supply.Food goes beyond mere sustenance; it serves as a conduit for expressing care, motivation, love, hospitality, and encouragement. Through our provision of food rations, we not only address basic needs but also contribute to fostering a sense of well-being and community support.And this is only possible thanks to the kindness of donors like you.- Your donation of $10 can provide meals for 5 days to someone living in hunger.- With $30, you can support 1 elderly person with 1 week of food rations and basic household essentials.- Your generous contribution of $60 can support 1 elderly person with 2 weeks of food rations and basic household essentials.- And with $120, you can provide 1 elderly person with 4 weeks of food rations and basic household essentials, putting a big smile on their face and allowing them to worry less about their next meal.We will also allocate your donations to support our operational expenses and other community programs.Your kindness and unwavering support mean the world to us and the people receiving help.Together, you and I can make a profound impact on the lives of those less fortunate in our community. Your donation will help ensure that no one in Whampoa, Toa Payoh, and Bishan goes to bed hungry.Your donation will help ensure that the tables for these underprivileged families and elderly are not empty during mealtimesYour support can change lives!To maintain our worthy cause, we invite you to be a part of this vital mission by making a donation or even a recurring donation today.Your contribution will help ensure that the tables of underprivileged families and elderly residents in our community are never empty during meal times.Thank you for your compassion and generosity.

In fact, according to a 2020 survey by Ministry of Health, young adults aged between 18 and 29 years had the highest proportion of poor mental health, at 21.5%.

Besides enhancing our students' mental resilience, the MHP also aims to impart them with first aid skills through workshops and interactive activities. This is so that they can detect mental health symptoms in their peers and timely intervene where appropriate.

My life started becoming mundane as I would spend my time watching television all day.A relative introduced me to St Luke's ElderCare (SLEC) and the nearest centre was no further than 10 minutes from my home. When I started attending day care services at Kebun Baru Centre, there were only a few elders as the centre was new. Staying Home during Circuit BreakerInitially, I was upset about having to stay at home as I was unable to meet my friends in the centre. However, the care staff engaged with us three times a week through Zoom sessions. I was able to chat with my friends from the centre and participate in acitivities such as Bingo and Guessing Games. Jun Jie, Centre Manager of Kebun Baru Centre, even serenaded us with our favourite songs while strumming the guitar.Going the Extra MileLast year, during one of the sessions at the centre, I started feeling unwell.

He was one of the pioneers in meteorological services who contributed significantly to the development of the meteorological department of Singapore. He is now 90 years of age and lives alone. His career in the meteorological services spanned 31 years and he received a long service medal from the then President of Singapore, Mr. Devan Nair, before retiring in 1984. Mr. Chee started his career as a radar operator before becoming a meteorological technician. Mr. Chee is among the pioneers who worked in Singapore before it achieved independence. Besides his service, determination and hard work, Mr. Chee was also innovative, and intelligent. He and his team developed the forecasting technique. where an instrument was released into the sky. It consisted of a thin plastic parachute, a reflector, and a radiosonde attached to the balloon filled with helium. This instrument would then be tracked by their radar to tell the direction and strength of the wind. The radiosonde could transmit data regarding other weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. This was the information that was sent to weather forecast offices such as the airport. Mr Chee speaks English and is an alumnus of Anglo-Chinese Catholic School in Penang. He was a victim of the Bukit Ho Swee fire which burned down his house and certificates. He was subsequently relocated to Jalan Satu in Kallang in the early 1980s. Let's honour and be grateful to our pioneer seniors for their contribution and dedication. They have made Singapore what it is today!
