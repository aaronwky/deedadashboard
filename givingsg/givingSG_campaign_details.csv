It can be just as challenging for people who live with or care for someone with disabilities. Friends and family may too find it difficult to come to terms with the condition or adapt to new challenges and suffer from caregiver's burnout.

In the effort to enhance the mental health of our beneficiaries in these challenging times, FDS is implementing a Mental Wellness Programme where we will be providing our friends with disabilities and their caregivers virtual counselling sessions. Weekly Group Psychoeducation Sessions will be conducted to teach our beneficiaries and caregivers life skills, coping skills and self-care techniques.

The strava deets are updated as I progress.   Current km count: 62.8km/73km  BACKGROUND  I've spent many years of my life involved with CWS in a volunteer capacity and serving on the Board. It's been exhausting - just look at my face. But believe me, this work is incredibly rewarding because we've driven change both for our Singapore cats and the people who help them.   As the Society has grown, so has the volume of our work and sheer expenses. In 2023, we spent $1.2m on our programmes - almost 60% of this was spent on neutering alone. We only raised about 50% of these costs through donations with the remaining coming from grant income and merchandise sales.   2024 is already an expensive year and with the immense amount of work to be done for the Cat Management Framework, every donation counts now more than ever. ","Cat Welfare Society is a charity that advocates the harmonious co-existence of humans and cats. We are at the forefront of humane management of the community cat population and educating the importance of responsible cat ownership.   For years, we have campaigned against the destruction of cats by offering a more effective and long term solution - education and sterilisation. As a charity, we function as a network of three staff, ten board members, twenty core volunteers and countless dedicated caregivers, rescuers, fosters and rehomers who work towards the same goal.  We are heavily reliant on donations to continue our work. We are a registered charity with IPC status that is audited annually and we publish our financial reports on our website.  ---  The Cat Welfare Society (CWS) is a Singapore-based society registered under the Societies Act (Cap. 311 of Singapore).

We have come a long way, and we take great pride in the impact that we have had on the Singapore cultural landscape.   At TNS, we firmly believe in the potential of socially engaged theatre to create positive societal change. We've mentored countless young and creative theatre practitioners, many who now lead other theatre companies and arts institutions in Singapore.   However, we are driven to do more.  That is why we introduced our Associate Artists Programme (AAP) in 2023, to nurture and showcase emerging creative voices and leaders within TNS. Our inaugural Associate Artists Deonn Yang and Sindhura Kalidas exceeded our expectations with their remarkable productions. Deonn directed Survivor Singapore at the Esplanade, while Sindhura served as playwright and co-director for the recently sold-out Happy Indian Women. In 2024, they will be joined by two more promising theatre-makers A Yagnya and Lim Shien Hian.

With outstanding arrears and debts, she struggled to make ends meet. To survive, Priya took on part-time jobs, but much of her earnings went towards repaying debts, leaving her with little to put food on the table.  A glimmer of hope shone when Priya learned about the Singapore Red Cross - Fairprice Meals with Love programme from a social worker. Ever since she enrolled in the programme in January 2024, she has been receiving $150 worth of supermarket vouchers monthly to alleviate her financial woes.  ""Without family support, I was not sure how I was going to eat or survive, otherwise  I would go hungry. I am very grateful for these vouchers. Thank you, they alleviate my financial burden,"" Priya says.

When our team rescued her, it became clear that she needed immediate medical attention. Liona had a concerning lump on her paw, which required two surgeries to give her a fighting chance.  The first surgery removed the lump for a biopsy, and unfortunately, it was confirmed to be cancerous. Liona’s journey didn’t end there—she had to undergo a second surgery to amputate her toe to prevent the spread of cancer. Thankfully, the procedure was a success! The margins from her second surgery were clean, and further x-rays and ultrasound scans showed no signs of cancer spreading.  Now, Liona has a fresh start and a new lease on life. With her health stabilized, she can begin her rehabilitation at the shelter, and soon she’ll be ready to find a loving forever home. However, her surgeries and medical care have resulted in significant vet bills, and we need your help to cover these costs.

Four years ago, Halim received the life-altering news of his kidney failure diagnosis. Instead of succumbing to despair, he chose to fight back his challenges with unwavering determination and positivity.  Halim faced significant obstacles, including leaving behind a 20-year career as a gym consultant, while coping with high blood pressure and gout. Yet, through it all, he drew strength from the love and support of his family and friends, as well as the compassionate care from the National Kidney Foundation (NKF).  Since starting haemodialysis in 2021, Halim has not only managed his health but has also transformed his journey into a beacon of hope for others.

Halim inspires everyone around him by advocating for healthy living and the importance of early health screenings.  This season of giving, let’s honour Halim and others like him.

For this special concert, Zita will be performing a selection of rarely performed songs from the B-side of Anita Mui’s classic Cantonese albums – from her first full-length album《赤色梅艷芳》, her iconic best-selling albums 《坏女孩》and 《妖女》, to her albums in the later part of her career such as《歌之女》and《I’m So Happy》.  Audiences can look forward to hearing Anita Mui’s songs that are rarely performed live, such as 《痴痴爱一次》and 《交出我的心》.

Seriously ill or injured children often need to spend weeks or months in a hospital for the necessary treatment. It is not only an incredibly long time to be away from home but also for a family to be divided - usually with the mother at the bedside of the sick child, leaving the father or relatives to take care of the siblings.

APPEAL TO SUPPORT CENTRE FOR FATHERING Centre for Fathering (CFF) was founded in 2000 to transforms the lives of fathers and children, and impact families. Since taking on the national DADs for Life movement in 2015 to inspire and engage more fathers to be involved, we have transformed thousands of families, including many whose fathers are incarcerated or from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, the work is far from accomplished.  Last year, we equipped more than 5,000 fathers with our programmes and supported over 50 father groups. This is only a drop in the ocean compared to the number of fathers we need to reach. About 15,000 men in Singapore become fathers annually, which means there are about 200,000 fathers with children up to 12 years old that need equipping and support.   That’s where you come in. We are asking for your help to achieve the $2.5M fundraising target to achieve our goals and make a difference to the lives of those we serve. Our fund-raising event will take place on:   Date: 11 April 2025, 7pm Venue: The Mandarin Oriental Hotel With Guest of Honour: Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth,  and Second Minister for Law;  Patron, Centre for Fathering  We invite you to join us to celebrate CFF’s 25th Anniversary and DADs for Life’s 15th Anniversary, and we look forward to hosting you with an evening of exciting activities.  Your support and donation will go a long way in supporting our efforts to grow the fathering movement. With your help we can a real difference in the lives of those we serve.

For more than 20 years, CFF has inspired numerous fathers to become the fathers their children need and strengthened many families through workshops and events in schools, communities, prisons, religious organisations and corporate offices.  CFF has also championed the DADs for Life movement since 2015 to inspire fathers to be good influencers of their children, and a father figure to those who do not have fathers. In 2019, CFF extended its reach and scope to support mothers too, when MUMS for Life was launched, to complement DADS for Life.  Your support of and partnership with CFF have enabled us to engage over 300,000 families and equip more than 5,000 fathers and 2,500 mothers through four nationwide initiatives, five father-child experiential workshops and 30 programmes for dads and for mums across life stages each year.

We need clothes as we are left with the only ones we were wearing when we fled from our homes for safety. ""   Abed's story above reflects the experiences of nearly a million others who have fled their homes in search of safety in Lebanon. Their only wish is for their children to survive.   With the conflict crisis spreading from the South to Beirut, Bekaa, and beyond, 1.7 million children living in Lebanon face death, injury, and forced displacement. Schools have closed, and are being repurposed into temporary shelters for thousands of internally displaced people. More than 2,000 people have been killed including children and women. Over 6,000 have been injured and over a million people have been displaced. There are children, who are going up to 24 hours without food, pregnant women sleeping on floors without a mattress or blanket in the cold weather, and nursing mothers so hungry that they cannot produce milk for their babies.     World Vision is on the ground and responding to the emergency needs of the most vulnerable children and families in Lebanon, providing essential aid to children and families. World Vision has provided life-saving assistance including food and water, mattresses, and hygiene kits to over 34,000 internally displaced people.

World Vision Singapore is a branch of World Vision International, and is a registered charity with Commissioner of Charities in Singapore.   In planning, implementing and evaluating its work, World Vision staff considers the basic needs of the child and the dynamics of the particular child's community. Does the child have a healthy diet? Is he or she attending school? Does the child have access to adequate health care, clean water, housing and clothing? Do his or her parents have an opportunity to improve the family's condition by growing more food or starting a small business?   All projects are regularly measured against such goals and objectives. Audits are conducted regularly by field staff and occasionally by outside consultants to ensure that the project is on track and is meeting the specific goals established by community leaders and World Vision.

Living in a rental flat, he survives on limited government aid and frequently visits the hospital due to recurrent falls.

One memorable moment came when Uncle Tung fell and was left helpless for nearly 13 hours until his CWA caregiver found him and got him the medical help he needed.  Despite his struggles, Uncle Tung is immensely grateful for the support from CWA, which he calls a “gift from heaven.” His greatest wish is to see his children again, but until then, he finds solace in the care and hope provided by CWA.

Our programmes focus on intervention work, including preventive, remedial and holistic development (character, moral values, social and emotional well-being) to reduce potential problems such as crime, drug abuse and poor academic, physical, social and mental health.  We have seen that challenging family situations such as financial challenges, parental incarceration and neglect, cause much emotional stress, trauma and wounds in their children. When a child experiences such stressors in the long run, their cognitive and emotional development are hindered.   They find it harder to develop essential traits such as resilience and grit, which are crucial to help them break out of their circumstances. This also sets them back earlier on in life.  Life Community intervenes to close these gaps, so no child or youth is left behind.

"3158422","Help Coco Feel Love and Care in Her Golden Years","SOSD","Sweet Coco, a devoted mother dog, has been through so much from living her life as a stray, however she has always shown her love for her four children from being out in the streets by allowing them to eat first at meal time and this continues even when they came to us at the shelter.    Just one day, we found her struggling to breathe, and her appetite gone. After an emergency vet visit, we learned she was battling more than we could imagine—B1 heart disease, a tumor near her heart, other existing tumors, and pancreatitis. She spent more than two weeks in the hospital, fighting hard just to get stable.  But Coco is a fighter. Today, she’s still with us, under palliative care, and even though her health is fragile, she’s happy. On good days, she enjoys the little things—like feeling the grass under her paws during short walks. We’re hoping to reunite her with her four children, who are still at the shelter, while she’s feeling well enough. We know it would mean the world to them and to her.  Coco’s journey isn’t over yet.

We want to give her and other dogs like her the best care in their twilight years.  Your donation can make that possible. Help us keep Coco comfortable and cared for, just as she’s cared for her children throughout her life. Let’s make sure she knows love until the very end.","SOSD is committed to enhancing the welfare of Singapore's street dogs.

Recognizing the value of community and the importance of creative expression, we have designed a series of programs that aim to bring joy, companionship, and a sense of purpose to our senior participants.  Our activities include newspaper handbag making, where the elderly can craft beautiful, functional items from recycled materials. This activity not only promotes sustainability but also provides a therapeutic and rewarding experience, allowing participants to express their creativity while contributing to an eco-friendly initiative.  We also offer music therapy sessions, a powerful tool that taps into the emotional and cognitive benefits of music. These sessions are carefully curated to include a mix of Western and Eastern music, offering both passive listening experiences and active participation through singing, instrument playing, and movement exercises. Music therapy has been shown to improve mood, reduce stress, and enhance memory, making it an invaluable part of our program.  In addition, our campaign includes various handmaking activities, such as rock painting and leaf painting, which allow the elderly to engage in tactile and artistic endeavors. These activities are not only enjoyable but also help in maintaining fine motor skills and stimulating mental activity. The act of creating something with their hands fosters a sense of achievement and boosts self-esteem.  Through these activities, we aim to create a supportive and nurturing environment where the elderly can socialize, learn new skills, and feel valued.

There are close to one million work permit holders in Singapore. Access to affordable healthcare can be a problem for low wage migrant workers as foreigners in Singapore do not receive subsidies for healthcare at public institutions. By law, workers are supposed to be covered for both inpatient and outpatient treatment by their employers but not all do. In addition, fear of repatriation and cultural and language barriers also contribute to migrant workers not receiving proper treatment.  The more unfortunate amongst these workers get injured at work and may end up losing their jobs and suffering loss of pay for a protracted period. The wait for their work injury compensation application to be processed and resolved can take months or years.  From a single clinic providing GP services in Geylang to meet the needs of the workers, HealthServe has expanded our range of services to the provision of GP and specialist medical services, rehabilitation and dental services, injury and salary-related casework support, social assistance, counselling and mental health programmes.  We are very much a volunteer-run organisation. Our operations are run by a small staff team and hundreds of medical and non-medical volunteers and interns.

Yet, for far too many, the cost of mental health services is a significant barrier to seeking the help they desperately need.   The National Population Health Survey 2023 reports that 15% of Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 are dealing with poor mental health, with younger adults (18 to 29 years) having the highest rate at 26%. Despite these alarming figures, the reality is that most are not receiving the care they need. The 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study found that 78.6% of adults with mental health conditions did not receive treatment in the past year.   One of the biggest concerns? Financial cost.  Three out of four people who chose not to seek treatment cited financial concerns as a major deterrent (Source: CNA). For many, mental health care seems like a luxury they simply can’t afford, leaving them vulnerable and untreated.  We need your support to change this.   How You Can Help   WINGS spreads its wings of support to all demographics from children to adults. Your support enables us to provide counselling services to a diverse population. We offer counselling services with a fee of $80 for the first session and $60 for subsequent sessions.

One of the many lives you will touch is that of 3-year-old Idris Athmar. Diagnosed with macrocephaly, Idris enrolled in our Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) in 2023. At that time, he could not walk, crawl or roll over, and had to rely on an oxygen tube due to a chronic lung disease.  Despite facing financial hardships, Idris’ mother was deeply committed to ensuring her son received the best care possible.  She took on a part-time role as a student care assistant to dedicate herself fully to Idris’ needs.  To support his development, SPD provided Idris with the highest level of subsidies.    Thanks to the dedicated efforts of SPD’s EIPIC team, comprising teachers and therapists, working alongside his parents, Idris has made remarkable progress.  He has learned to play with various toys and interact with his peers. His motor skills have improved, today, he can walk, climb steps, and even paint. Additionally, Idris can now express his feelings and needs, which he previously could not do.  Idris is one of the 11,000 people with disabilities supported by SPD last year   Please take a moment to consider the impact your donations can make. Regardless of the amount, every contribution counts and will help to transform lives. If a monthly commitment is not possible, we also welcome one-time contributions.  Recurring donations via this campaign is not possible. Hence, please visit www.giving.sg/spd to set up your recurring donation. We look forward to welcoming you as a new STAR monthly donor and partnering with you on this meaningful journey to uplift lives together.  ","SPD is a local charity set up in 1964 to help people with disabilities maximise their potential and be a part of mainstream society.  We are here to help children and youths with special needs reach for the stars and be the best that they can be through early intervention and educational support.  We strive to boost the self-reliance and mobility of persons with disabilities within the community, and we do so through therapy services, assistive technology and the support and encouragement of our care team.  Our day care programmes provide respite to families, making it possible for persons with disabilities to stay with their loved ones at home for as long as possible without having to resort to institutional care.  A strong advocate for inclusive employment, we train people with disabilities and work with them to seek suitable employment opportunities so that they can be financially independent and lead a full and engaged life.  After more than 50 years, we remain focused and committed to enabling people with disabilities."

"3061375","Empower The Fight Against Breast Cancer","Singapore Cancer Society","Breast cancer remained the most common cancer among Singapore women in the past 50 years (National Registry of Diseases Office 2024).      Breast cancer has been linked to several risk factors including age, family history of breast cancer, smoking, high-fat diet and obesity. The earlier breast cancer is diagnosed, the better the chances for successful treatment. As early breast cancer usually does not present with any symptoms, screening is therefore important.   According to the Health Promotion Board's National Population Health Survey 2023, only 34.7%* of Singaporean women aged 50 to 69 have had a screening mammogram over the past two years. This is a drop compared to the survey done in 2019. More needs to be done to encourage women to attend mammogram as Early Detection Saves Lives.

Before suffering a stroke, Mr Lim spent most of his working years as a chef, and his love for food and cooking brought him to manage a canteen in Jurong Island while working part-time as a chef trainer, before he opened a chicken rice stall at a food court in Boon Lay.  Despite retiring after his stroke, Mr Lim hopes to teach cooking to prison inmates to help them reintegrate into society. He shares, “I'm thankful that TOUCH has helped me through a difficult period of my life. I hope to become better and more independent so that I can volunteer and give back to society!”  Make a difference today and donate to help empower seniors like Mr Lim under our care!

But I underestimated its severity and never expected that it would make me pay such a high price in life!  Health is the most important pillar in life. When it crumbles, everything else — family, work, and more will quickly fall apart.""  ~ Mr Shashitharen Ambalaka, 41, on dialysis for 4 years    Shashitharen was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the young age of 16. However, he didn’t consider it a serious matter. He enjoyed sports but often neglected his insulin shots and indulged in unhealthy eating habits. Life seemed normal – until it wasn’t.  The harsh reality struck when he was 32. During a pilgrimage to India, a seemingly minor burn on his foot developed into a severe infection, leading to the amputation of the top half of his right foot. This life-altering event forced him to confront the brutal reality of living with a disability. The active life he once knew was gone as he began relying on a wheelchair. His disability became a significant obstacle to his career advancement as an accountant, derailing his path to a management role.  The nightmare didn’t end there. At 36, Shashitharen suffered a stroke, leaving the left side of his body paralysed. Six months later, his kidneys failed due to diabetes, forcing him onto thrice-weekly dialysis just to sustain his life.   Though diabetes is a painful reminder of the high price he has paid, Shashitharen hopes his story will serve as a wake-up call for others and encourage them to take the disease seriously. “Kidney failure is a silent killer with no turning back. Good health is the greatest gift you can give your loved ones this Festival of Lights!” he reflects.  As we celebrate Deepavali, the festival of light, we invite you to join us in our life-saving mission of Giving Life & Hope, brightening the lives of those in need with essential kidney care.  *This charity drive is an initiative under Seasons of Love.","The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) is currently supporting about 5,500 kidney failure patients, about two-thirds of the national kidney failure patient population.

The lessons have been so helpful to me,” says Alex, a Primary 5 student.    Alex’s journey has not been smooth. He was placed in out-of-home care due to family issues, leaving behind the comfort of home and loved ones. School was also tough. With ADHD and dyslexia, Alex struggled to focus and understand his lessons, often feeling disheartened and overwhelmed.   Hope arrived when Alex joined the learning support programme through the Dyslexia Association of Singapore in 2023. Tailored lessons crafted to his learning needs helped him progress at his own pace. Over time, Alex grew more confident in tackling previously daunting topics for him. His potential came to light as he went from failing his English assessments to scoring an impressive 83 marks in his 2024 mid-year exam.   __________  In Singapore, children under 18 can be separated from their families due to heartbreaking circumstances like abuse, neglect, or the loss/incarceration of their parents. They are placed in temporary care, such as foster families or children’s homes.  Among these children, there is an even more vulnerable group: those with special learning needs. Many have been diagnosed with conditions like Dyslexia, ADHD, and other developmental challenges. These children attend mainstream schools but often struggle to cope. They lack essential academic skills and face behavioural and psychological hurdles that leave them feeling isolated and far behind their peers. They need specialised learning support to catch up, but the costs of such programmes are difficult for caregivers to take on as many are already financially stretched.  __________  How You Can Help  World Vision Singapore is committed to standing in the gap for children like Alex.

These are part of broader efforts to achieve its national climate target of net zero emissions by 2050. Since then, Singapore has signaled its interest in advancing the potential of carbon credits through various bilateral arrangements.  While much of the world's known blue carbon ecosystems exist in this region, unlocking their potential for producing high-quality carbon credits is complicated by unique and localized challenges. These challenges frequently involve local laws, policies and institutional frameworks that influence the generation and sale of carbon credits. They may include issues such as land rights and legal tenure, benefit-sharing mechanisms and social and environmental safeguards. In response to such challenges, we aim to develop capacity and capabilities in localized climate and blue carbon policy, in Singapore. This will support more effective stakeholder engagement, and the preparation and conduct of focused outreach sessions and workshops involving government and community stakeholders. We will leverage our global experts and our partners to identify areas for improvement in policy-making and capacity-building.  By supporting capacity and capabilities building necessary for creating the enabling conditions for high-quality blue carbon projects, the funds raised will thus provide access by the Singapore government and Singapore companies to viable opportunities for meeting the nation's carbon targets.

From coastline to high seas, the ocean has played a principal role in Singapore's history and economy, and is an important part of Singapore's food security and climate goals. On the coastlines in this region, mangrove are working hard to protect communities from erosion and extreme weather, and to help maintain water quality. In addition, these structurally diverse ecosystems sustain high biodiversity and rich seafood supplies: 75% of commercial fish species spend part of their lives in these coastal areas. But coastal ecosystems and the ocean life they support are coming under threat from development, unsustainable fishing practices, marine pollution, and climate change. In 2023, a new United Nations agreement was adopted, allowing the establishment of marine protected areas and other conservation efforts on the high seas. This offers opportunity and impetus to expand appreciation of the benefits of ocean conservation for livelihoods and well-being. The funds will go toward government and community engagements and communication campaigns, to assist Singapore in protecting 30% of the ocean by 2030, in line with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the recently adopted High Seas Treaty.

For many children in low-income households, this is a harsh reality. In Singapore, the cost of living continues to rise, and many families are struggling to make ends meet. When resources are limited, children often suffer the most, especially when it comes to basic necessities like food.  Hunger affects more than just physical health. It hampers a child’s ability to learn, grow, and enjoy the simple joys of childhood. But it doesn’t have to be this way.  With your support, we can change the story for these children. Our campaign is dedicated to ensuring that underprivileged children receive the nutritious meals they need to thrive. These meals are not just about feeding a child for a day; they are about providing the nourishment needed to fuel their dreams and aspirations.  Join us in this mission to fight hunger and nourish hope. Your generosity can turn despair into joy, giving these children the energy and optimism they need to pursue their dreams. Together, we can build a community where no child has to suffer from hunger, and every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.","Children's Wishing Well (CWW) is a registered charity and IPC founded in 2002.

For many women diagnosed with breast cancer, the experience is filled with fear and uncertainty.  One survivor shared: “I was only 39 when diagnosed. I was so scared when I got the diagnosis as I did not know if I would die and not see my child grow up. So many thoughts crossed my mind during that time. Who was going to look after my child? Would I have enough money to treat the condition? Who would care for me through chemotherapy?” In these overwhelming moments, breast cancer support groups provide an invaluable source of strength and reassurance.

Our programmes focus on intervention work, including preventive, remedial and holistic development (character, moral values, social and emotional well-being) to reduce potential problems such as crime, drug abuse and poor academic, physical, social and mental health.  We have seen that challenging family situations such as financial challenges, parental incarceration and neglect, cause much emotional stress, trauma and wounds in their children. When a child experiences such stressors in the long run, their cognitive and emotional development are hindered.   They find it harder to develop essential traits such as resilience and grit, which are crucial to help them break out of their circumstances. This also sets them back earlier on in life.

"2715872","Fund raising for performance for Siddhartha by Herman Hesse","World-in-Theatre Ltd","Siddhartha is a play by Sonny Lim which was adapted from Herman Hesse's 1922 novel of the same name. This new production will be directed by Elizabeth de Roza. The play was first staged in 1997 under the direction of William Teo and was produced by his company Asia-in-Theatre Research Centre. Dealing with the poignant journey of a young man in search of meaning and personal enlightenment in 7th century India, the play's themes resound even more potently today in a larger world that is being reshaped by ever more potent geopolitical conflicts, radical socio-technological upheavals, and the heroic battles of mother nature to heal, rebalance and restore itself. In such a world, how is a human being to navigate their way towards survival, meaning and self-fulfilment? This new production of the play Siddhartha, 27 years after its original premiere in Singapore, will be an attempt to explore this conundrum in a world that has grown even more fragile and less certain. True to World-in-Theatre's commitment to bringing to the stage works of universal significance and resonance, this production of the play will also mark the theatre company's full return after the constraints and travails of the covid pandemic.","Inspired by working with one of the pioneering figures of Singapore theatre in the 1980s, the late William Teo, a group of his key performers founded World-In-Theatre in 2002. Their commitment to giving Singaporeans an opportunity to see the great traditional and modern classics of world theatre is deserving of support. Without such opportunities, there is no way to impart knowledge to the younger generation about the great plays of the world in an era when commercial considerations hold much greater sway.  The arts have a significant role in Singapore, especially as the nation continues to stake its claim as a world city and cultural hub, and World-in-Theatre aims to contribute to Singapore as it has been doing for the past 22 years."

My journey has been anything but ordinary, and today, I want to share with you the story of how I turned a life-altering event into a mission to help others.  In 2012, my life took an unexpected turn. A stroke left me with a paralyzed left hand, turning even the simplest tasks into monumental challenges. It was a moment of profound vulnerability, where the future seemed uncertain. But in that uncertainty, I found a new purpose.  Baking became my therapy—a way to reclaim control over my life. With only one functioning hand, I started experimenting in the kitchen, determined to create something beautiful out of the chaos. And so, OHBaker was born. What began as a personal journey of recovery quickly grew into a passion for crafting artisanal baked goods that bring joy to others.  But my story doesn't end in the kitchen. As I navigated my own recovery, I realized the importance of community and support for stroke survivors. This led me to take on the role of Vice President at SNSA, where I now work to advocate for stroke awareness, prevention, and recovery programs across Singapore.  Through our annual event, Stepping Out for Stroke (SOFS), and other initiatives, we aim to raise awareness and funds to support stroke survivors on their journey to recovery. This Giving.sg campaign is a crucial part of that effort. Your support will help us provide resources, rehabilitation programs, and community outreach to those affected by stroke.  Every dollar you contribute brings us closer to a world where stroke survivors are empowered to rebuild their lives. Together, we can make a difference—one step, one bake, and one act of kindness at a time.

Join me in empowering stroke survivors to rise above their challenges. Every donation will directly impact the lives of survivors and their families, helping them regain their strength and hope. Your support means the world to me and to countless others on their path to recovery.","Singapore National Stroke Association (SNSA) is a non-profit organization and national support group for stroke survivors and caregivers. Founded in 1996 by stroke survivors and caregivers, with guidance from doctors and health professionals, SNSA organizes free programmes, events, and activities to support holistic rehabilitation. Our initiatives provide stroke survivors and caregivers with relevant knowledge and a sense of solidarity, demonstrating that there is life after stroke. Additionally, we engage and educate the public on stroke prevention, risks, consequences, and rehabilitation.  SNSA strives to offer an avenue of help, support, and information to stroke survivors and caregivers in their hour of need. We also aim to raise and promote public awareness and education about stroke.  SNSA champions the rights of stroke survivors and their caregivers, serving as their voice and advocate."

He never give any money for our family, then mortgage loan he also never pay anything. That time I really struggled.”   Mdm Asha (not her real name) took steps to protect herself and her two daughters from her husband, which caused him to leave the family. Despite being a homemaker and not fluent in English, Mdm Asha stepped up to take on the role of sole breadwinner by working in blue-collar jobs to sustain her family.  With hefty expenses such as monthly school fees of almost $1,000 that cannot be subsidised and an unpaid mortgage loan on a single income, Mdm Asha found it extremely hard to make ends meet. Yet she values education, and her daughters are motivated to study despite limited resources and guidance as well as adverse circumstances owing to financial strain.   New Life’s financial assistance programme, Project Love, provided Mdm Asha with food vouchers and subsidies for her daughters’ school fees. Her caseworkers also advised her to switch from part-time work to full-time work for better prospects. Mdm Asha is determined to keep her children in school until her elder daughter starts working and hopes to improve her English and upskill.   Without intervention to keep children in school and meet short-term needs, lower-income families like Mdm Asha’s would live hand-to-mouth without security or prospects. Project Love helps many such families in need tide through dire straits until they can achieve financial stability.  We need your help to ensure that children are not deprived of education due to financial reasons and their families can achieve better life outcomes.

"2632201","Enable seniors to prepare for end-of-life with confidence","ALLKIN SINGAPORE LTD","Death is often a “taboo” topic approached with awkwardness and apprehension. However, open, honest conversations about life and death are important to prepare for end-of-life – from letting our loved ones know our care wishes, to making afterlife arrangements.  At Allkin Singapore, we believe that every person deserves to live a meaningful, dignified life from beginning to end. For seniors in the community, this means not only ageing healthily, but being equipped with the resources and capabilities they need to plan for their later years with confidence and assurance.  Unfortunately, many seniors fail to plan adequately due to a lack of awareness about available options or the difficulty of navigating complex processes. This results in unfulfilled wishes and unnecessary stress on themselves and their loved ones, especially if illness hits.  To address these gaps, Allkin’s Good-To-Go programme equips seniors aged 50 and above with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to make informed decisions about end-of-life matters and advocate for their own wellbeing. Through awareness talks and groupwork sessions, Good-To-Go educates seniors about early planning tools and provides a supportive space for seniors to discuss life and death – in an environment closer to home and at no cost.  Your donation will help to sustain and improve Good-To-Go, ensuring this community-based programme remains free and accessible for seniors from all walks of life. Your support can enable more seniors to live their twilight years with dignity and peace of mind, so they can finish the race as strongly as they started it.","Founded in 1978 as Singapore's first family service centre, Allkin Singapore is a community-driven social service agency that believes everyone has the potential to create positive change, regardless of age, race, or background.

This self-sustained challenge spans six stages, where we will navigate sandy dunes and rocky terrain, facing temperatures that can reach up to 50°C.   Running the MDS is not just about the physical endurance required to complete such an extreme race; it symbolizes the resilience and strength of individuals living with rare disorders. Each step we take in the Sahara represents the uphill battles faced by those affected by these conditions—battles that often go unnoticed and unsupported.  Many individuals with rare disorders encounter daily challenges that can be as daunting as running through unforgiving terrain. They navigate a complex healthcare landscape, face social stigma, and often feel isolated in their struggles. By participating in the MDS , we aim to shine a light on their experiences, raising awareness and funds to support vital research, resources, and community-building initiatives.  Every kilometer we run serves as a reminder that while we may face physical challenges in the desert, those with rare disorders face emotional and medical obstacles every day. Our journey is fueled by the hope of creating a stronger support network for these individuals and their families, ensuring they know they are not alone.  Our fundraising campaign aims to:  1. Raise Awareness for rare disorders by funding essential research and resources.  2. Empower Individuals to embrace their uniqueness and challenges.  3. Build a Supportive Community for those facing rare disorders, ensuring they know they are not alone.  Join us in making a difference for those who inspire us with their courage and resilience .

This will support:  • STEM Education Programmes — Through which we have reached over 32,000 girls and young women, encouraging them to explore and pursue careers in STEM.  • UWS Boys Empowered programme—Singapore’s first-ever programme for preventing gender-based violence by redefining male stereotypes and advocating for healthy masculinity  • Other Initiatives — In the past year alone, we have impacted over 8,500 individuals through our programmes on workplace harassment, allyship, and unconscious bias.

Just like a flower needs sunlight, water, and nourishment to thrive, our women need opportunities to grow and flourish. Adopting World Health Organization’s ICOPE framework, we focus on enhancing the intrinsic capacities of Cognition, Mental Health, Physical Mobility, Nutrition, Vision, and Hearing of older women.   Our diverse programmes at WINGS offer women aged 40 and above to discover new passions, build social connections, and maintain their cognitive and physical well-being, empowering them to continue contributing to society.   These women’s lives bloomed anew with WINGS:  Meet M Huat, a retired healthcare worker and dedicated caregiver, whose life was transformed and blossomed to a greater height. In her 80’s and overwhelmed by caregiving responsibilities, she found solace and joy in creating beautiful art pieces. Our programmes not only sparked her creativity but also provided a much-needed respite, expanding her social circle while stimulating her cognitive function and working her hand dexterity. From M Huat: “I feel privileged and really appreciate WINGS for allowing me to learn and improve my social connections.”  Once self-employed with little time for herself, Brenda, now in her mid-60’s, has reignited her joy of lifelong learning and passion for healthy living through WINGS. Brenda’s enthusiasm for continual learning, evident in her embrace of digital technology, has positively impacted her relationship with her grandchildren whilst keeping her mind sharp. She uses her digital skill to help the terminally ill capture their life stories through the production of personal legacy videos. This powerhouse has also started a Slow Run group for seniors, fostering a supportive community, whilst empowering older women to stay physically and mentally resilient. ","Established since 2007, WINGS is the only non-profit in Singapore singularly focused on helping women through their later years by providing transformative learning and activities focused on the 6 areas of functional health - Cognitive, Mental Health, Mobility, Vision, Hearing and Nutrition. We strive to keep older women functionally independent and prevent frailty.   Our Vision Ageing Well, Living Well  Our Mission WINGS empowers women to age well, by staying healthy, being financially secure and staying socially engaged.  Why is our focus on women still relevant today? 1) The number of older women living alone has increased by 40% over the past 15 years. 2) Women outlive men by 4 years on average with more illness and disability during those years. 3) The average female CPF balance is just 80% of the average male. 4) 60% of Caregivers in Singapore are women. They sacrifice career for caregiving and have less money for retirement. The quality of care that older women can provide to others depends firstly on the protection of their own well-being. 5) According to the WHO (World Health Organization), ageing & health programmes must be tailored for women to be effective."

John Choo, 41, has Cerebral Palsy and uses a wheelchair. He requires full assistance with activities of daily living such as toileting and washing. John has been receiving day care services at the SPD Activity Centre (DAC) daily since 1999.   John’s primary caregiver is his 72-year-old mother, whose declining health and age prevent her from working. She occasionally sells cardboards and cans donated by neighbours to supplement the family’s income.  Training officers from the DAC continue to work closely with John to improve his daily living skills such as wiping tables after activity, buttoning his shirt, and sorting items.  Being from a low-income family, all fees for attending the DAC, including transportation, have been fully waived.  He also receives $50 worth of supermarket vouchers from the SPD Daily Needs Programme every month to help support his essential needs.  The Daily Needs Programme is still facing a shortfall, and we would appreciate your support to continue providing for families like John's. Every donation, no matter the amount, makes a meaningful impact. Your contribution will enable us to provide supermarket vouchers, offering much-needed financial relief and reducing daily burdens for those in need.  Please consider making a donation online today and help spread the word by sharing our campaign with your friends and family. Together, we can make a lasting difference! ","SPD is a local charity set up in 1964 to help people with disabilities maximise their potential and be a part of mainstream society.

From a young age, she showed remarkable eagerness to learn. Whether as an energetic gymnast, graceful dancer, fearless silat athlete, or during her weekends at Overrun Ice Cream Café, she embodied diligence, determination, and passion. Despite her young age, she had already lived a fulfilling life.  Tragically, while preparing for her national ‘O’ level examinations and training for her first International Silat Competition, she fell seriously ill with Influenza A, which led to complications affecting her brain stem. Despite the best efforts of doctors, she peacefully passed away on August 12th, 2022, surrounded by loved ones who came to bid her farewell—a testament to the profound impact she had on many lives. Though Nur Ratna Juita is no longer with us, her spirit remains cherished. Known for her selflessness and deep care for others, she initiated fundraising for Palestine at the tender age of 7 by making loom bands. Her efforts were highlighted on Mercy Relief’s Facebook page in July and August of 2014.

This changed when he witnessed his son’s birth, which brought him immense happiness and renewed his hope and determination to continue fighting for his life.   Despite the joy of having a child, Chee Seng was hit by more hardships. In 2019, both his kidneys were removed due to cyst bleeding. In 2021, he received more devasting news that his liver condition worsened with incurable cysts. On Christmas Eve, he received a life-saving liver transplant. He was filled with deep gratitude towards the donor who gifted him a precious second chance at life.  Even though he had a new liver, Chee Seng continued to battle ongoing health issues and thrice-weekly dialysis sessions of 4 hours each. Amidst his struggles, he remained determined to return to his career as a taxi driver after a seven-year hiatus. In late 2023, he successfully renewed his taxi license, which provided some relief from the financial burden on his wife, who works tirelessly as a cleaner to support the family.  “This journey has not been easy, but every moment with my family is precious. My son's laughter, my wife's unconditional love, and life's simple joys mean everything to me. Your generosity has kept us going. Thank you,” chimed Chee Seng.  As we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival, join us in Lighting Up Lives by making a meaningful contribution to brighten the lives   *This charity drive is one of the initiatives under Seasons of Love.","The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) is currently supporting about 5,500 kidney failure patients, about two-thirds of the national kidney failure patient population. Our patients are of the lower income group. Treating a patient costs over $2,000 a month, however, the treatment our patients receive is highly subsidised, with 75% paying $50 or less a month out-of-pocket.   NKF remains committed to journeying with our patients every step of the way in their treatment and rehabilitative care, advocating kidney health to prevent kidney failure and making a difference in the renal landscape to benefit the community.

Her curriculum also included essential workplace skills, health and fitness, and life skills. Kelly is also talented in arts and crafts such as drawing, painting and crochet. She actively participated in our events and booth sales, helping to sell her customised art pieces to raise funds.  Kelly’s home life is modest. Living in a 2-room flat, her father, the sole breadwinner, has raised Kelly and her elder brother, who also has special needs, alone since his divorce. Being a parent to children with special needs, her father’s main concern is that they would not be able to take good care of themselves when he is no longer around and thus, he hopes that they can secure employment and lead independent and meaningful lives.   To help improve her family’s financial situation, Kelly worked with our social workers to apply for financial assistance. Through financial aid, we were able to lessen her family’s financial burdens with waived training fees, monthly cash allowances for meals and transport, and insurance coverage.  With the knowledge and experience from her vocational training and support from our Employability Services team, Kelly is now gainfully employed in a community garden.  Your donation can empower individuals with special needs like Kelly, providing vocational training, realistic on-the-job training and employment support services. Help Kelly and others like her to achieve their full potential by making a donation today.  * To protect the identity of our beneficiary, her name has been changed and a volunteer model was used in the photographs.

"1592759","Providing Financial Assistance For Families And Children Impacted By Childhood Cancer","Children's Cancer Foundation","The emotional toll of childhood cancer is immeasurable but hidden beneath the surface is the crushing financial burden these families bear. When a child falls ill, families are confronted not only with the fear and uncertainty of a diagnosis but also the harsh reality of financial strain. Many parents are forced to make the distressing decision to leave their jobs, resulting in a loss of income and added stress.  At the tender age of 1, Hayden, a beneficiary of the Children's Cancer Foundation (CCF), was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia. Since November 2022, he has been bravely undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Hayden and his family have received invaluable support from CCF throughout this challenging period. The financial assistance CCF provided has helped ease the burden of increased expenses related to Hayden's treatment, covering essentials such as food, upkeep, and transportation to the hospital.  Your generous donation can make a profound difference for families like Hayden's. By contributing, you help ease their financial burden and provide them with the means to navigate the daily challenges of caring for a sick child.   In 2023, CCF supported 159 children and families with a total of $557,289. This year, we hope to raise $1,000,000 to support another 200 children and families in 2024/2025.  Join us in making a lasting impact. Bring hope and relief to those who need it the most! ","Children's Cancer Foundation (CCF) is a social service agency with a mission to improve the quality of life of children with cancer and their families and children impacted by cancer through enhancing their emotional, social and medical well-being. Founded in 1992, CCF provides children with cancer and their families the much needed support in their battle against the life threatening illness. Over the years, CCF has helped more than 3,700 children and their families at different stages of the illness and recovery. Make a donation to show your support today!"
"1592715","Support Children with Cancer in their Educational Journey!","Children's Cancer Foundation","When a child is diagnosed with cancer, their education often takes a backseat to urgent medical needs. This interruption causes significant academic setbacks and leads to social isolation and emotional distress. The loss of routine and connection with peers can be as devastating as the illness itself. Many of these children cannot continue their studies without support and may fall behind their peers.   Sean, a childhood cancer survivor, was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia at the age of 12 during his Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) year. He had to take a gap year due to his medical treatments. Fortunately, Sean was able to catch up on his studies by attending the Place for Academic Learning and Support (PALS) at the Children's Cancer Foundation (CCF) while he was in the remission phase. PALS facilitates academic learning in an infection-controlled environment for children with cancer who are unable to attend community schools.    Sean's determination and the support of the dedicated teachers at PALS led to remarkable achievements. He scored an impressive PSLE score and was recognized as a student leader in his secondary school. Now, Sean is pursuing his dream of taking an Information and Communications Technology course at Singapore Polytechnic.   You can be a crucial part of such transformative journey. Your donation will empower children impacted by childhood cancer, giving them the resources and support they need to build a promising future for themselves and their families.    Together, we can ensure that every child, regardless of their health status, has the chance to learn, grow, and envision a future full of possibilities.   Donate today and make a lasting impact on the lives of children like Sean!

The iQFOiL class has also been featured at two major regional games: the 2023 SEA Games and the 2023 Asian Games. We are also expecting the subsequent SEA Games in 2025 as well as the 2026 Asian Games to feature the Women’s iQFOiL class.

Every family has its own problems and Mdm Ang’s was no exception. She had to unwillingly abandon the marital home with two of her four children, and eke out a living as a seamstress. As her children got older, she had to juggle two jobs both in the day and the night to maintain their livelihoods.  Today, her family has grown and she has grandchildren and great-grandchildren. While she lives with her son in their flat in Tampines, she often finds herself feeling lonely when her family members are out at work.  Mdm Ang chanced upon the Singapore Red Cross’ (SRC) ElderAid programme, when a SRC team member happened to be in the vicinity. Since then, our volunteers have been visiting her regularly on weekdays, bringing her joy and the precious gift of friendship.  Mdm Linda Lum, a Community Befriender with the ElderAid programme, is one of the volunteers who would often visit Mdm Ang to ensure that she has a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on.

I’ve seen (and experienced!) how much they care for children and youths. Many of us have grown with Lakeside and managed to make our own way in the world, so I see it as a testament to the good work they have done. Without them, I doubt I would have as many opportunities to learn and play as a child.   And this is especially important for children and youths who are far less privileged. Their parents or caregivers may not have the time, money, or capacity to provide what most of us would consider a good childhood. For example, there are those who are affected by family conflict, financial struggles, bullying, poor mental health, and low self-esteem. All this on top of the usual growing pains.  I’m glad Lakeside steps in to address their needs so they have a chance to grow up happy, healthy and well-adjusted. Their services also evolve with each generation of children and youths. Plus, Lakeside does lots of good work like family and marriage enrichment for the adults in their lives as well, so issues are addressed holistically.   Future generations are depending on us, so let’s do what we can for them. I hope you will support Lakeside’s work with children and youths with a donation of any amount.

Apparel, equipment, prosthesis devices and accessories (e.g., comfortable footwear, digital devices, spectacles, dentures, hearing aids).  2. Programmes and activities that will keep them physically and meaningfully engaged. These include fun physical exercises, cognitive games, all-expenses-paid outings such as to places of interest, supermarkets and coffeeshops as well as special meal treats during festive occasions.","Out of passion to care for the physical, emotional and social well-being of the community, the St. Andrew's Medical Mission was founded in 1913 by Dr. Charlotte Ferguson-Davie, the wife of the first Anglican Bishop of Singapore who was also a medical doctor herself. Seeing the plight of the local women and children of that time and the lack of medical services for them, Dr. Ferguson-Davie set up a dispensary along Bencoolen Street for the destitute women and children. The Medical Mission continued to meet the locals' needs and thus led to the opening of more dispensaries and eventually, St. Andrew's Mission Hospital in 1923 and St. Andrew's Orthopaedic Hospital in 1939.  Working closely with the Government, SAMH constantly developed its services to meet the relevant needs of our local community at all times. Today, SAMH has under its operation: St. Andrew's Autism Centre, St. Andrew's Community Hospital, St. Andrew's Nursing Home, St. Andrew's Senior Care, St. Andrew's Migrant Worker Medical Centre, St. Andrew's Mission School and St. Andrew's Mission Hospital Clinic."

Unfortunately, children from low-income or underprivileged backgrounds don't always have the same opportunities and resources to turn their dreams into reality.

These obstacles not only make it difficult for them to realise their full potential, but also dim their confidence and motivation to pursue their dreams.

Our specially curated programs are also tailored to each child's unique needs, enabling them to regain their confidence and strengthen their abilities to succeed.  Your support is vital in enabling us to expand and enhance our Student Academy programmes to create more inclusive and comprehensive opportunities that nurture the next generation of leaders, innovators, and changemakers.  With your support, we can pave the way for a more inclusive future where every child receives the best possible care they deserve to realise their hopes and dreams.","Founded in 1978 as Singapore's first family service centre, Allkin Singapore is a community-driven social service agency that believes everyone has the potential to create positive change, regardless of age, race, or background.

Now, we seek the public’s support once again as we persevere in our campaign to raise awareness of the intrinsic value of a resting place of our pioneers, a site that has also in the last five decades become a habitat.   This year, Singapore Heritage Society (SHS) and all things Bukit Brown (atBB) begin a long-nurtured project to build a memorial called “Voices of Bukit Brown”, an outdoor installation designed from artefacts recovered from the exhumation of more than 4,000 graves to make way for Lornie Highway. We witnessed their exhumation, and for those unclaimed, we witnessed their final burial at sea. Now, we honour their memory with 80 unclaimed above-ground artefacts to create a uniquely designed soundscape that will give visitors a holistic experience of Bukit Brown. The memorial will also serve as an education node for schools to incorporate local history into their learning journeys.    This will require funding, and your continued support.   In the time that we started campaigning to save what is left of Bukit Brown, we have held two exhibitions, produced a book, written a blog, and contributed to various articles, documentaries and films on Bukit Brown. We won the first-ever World Monuments Fund listing for Singapore with the site. We have participated in Jane’s Walks annually, the National Heritage Board’s annual battlefield tours, and the Singapore Writers Festival in 2023.     The volunteers of all things Bukit Brown have guided more than 27,000 people to the site. We hope you will offer to contribute as a gesture of thanks for joining our walks so that we will be able to raise the funds required for the memorial.   We humbly ask for your support to ensure the habitat, heritage and history of Bukit Brown is not forgotten, is appreciated, and will be conserved for future generations.  ","GIVING A FUTURE TO OUR PAST  Founded in 1987 as a non-profit organisation, SHS is an independent voice for heritage conservation in Singapore.

They know the names of their medication instead of their classmates. Doctors, nurses and art therapists are their new family. Their laughter and their strength will make you cry.  If you have ever seen a child fight cancer, it will change your life forever.   Each year, an estimate of 160 children are diagnosed with cancer in Singapore.  Most common types of cancer in children are Leukaemia, Lymphoma and Central Nervous Systems Tumours (CNS Tumours), with a small percentage of rare Langerhans cell histiocytosis.   At LOVE, NILS, we provide emotional, social and community support to cancer patients and caregivers. We guide them through the healthcare system, provide professional therapies, community support and more.   As a registered IPC social service agency, our goal is to be there for them before, during and after treatment, every step of the way.  Every child deserves a chance at a healthy and happy life. Paediatric cancer doesn't just affect the child diagnosed, but also their families, friends, and communities.   Together, We Create Hope.  Join us in our Stories of Hope campaign and be a part of this life-changing mission.

Both parent and child face immense challenges to their well-being, such as anxiety, isolation and depression. To stand a better fighting chance, families need guidance, emotional care, a strong community and other forms of support that some hospitals may not be able to fully provide.  THE WORK - Holistic support with a difference. LOVE, NILS provides families with knowledge, resources and community support at every step of the way. We co-fund a Hospital Care Coordinator at National University Hospital.  As a patient navigator, she guides patients and caregivers to receive the help they need.      We believe it takes a village to heal a child. And that's why we hold regular toy drives, events, school programs and hospital visits involving many dedicated individuals, to keep children and caregivers socially engaged, hopeful and resilient. This way, they know they're not alone in the fight."

Mental disorders in individuals may have crippling effects on their personal and family lives. In families, we also see the destructive impact of mental health issues that may lead to the breakdown of marriages, behavioural problems with children, conflict situations, and a host of other relationship problems.   Many individuals struggle silently, lacking the resources or support to seek professional help. Stigma, financial constraints, and limited access to services often prevent people from seeking counselling. As a result, untreated mental health issues can escalate, which may lead to profound personal and societal issues.   How you can help  Accessibility to timely and personalised counselling services is a lifeline for those grappling with emotional distress, ranging from trauma, stress-related issues, depression, anxiety and a host of other presenting issues.   Financial contributions to support subsidised counselling services impacts the lives of individuals, couples, and families – offering them hope and a path towards holistic healing.   Many of EMCC’s clients would not have been able to receive such help if not for the help of donors, which enables EMCC to provide subsidised counselling services to them.  On average, clients would require at least 5 counselling sessions for meaningful change to happen. However, this is rarely enough for them to reach their mental health goals.     We are aiming to raise a total of SGD288,000 to provide some 530 individuals, couples, or families with subsidised counselling. To ensure that the counselling sessions lead to holistic recovery for our clients, a minimum of five sessions would often be encouraged.   By supporting EMCC, you also play a pivotal role in breaking down barriers to mental health care and creating a supportive environment where people are empowered to seek the help they need.","Through counselling therapy and mediation, EMCC helps adults, children and youth to build psychological resilience and strength.

On 12 June 2017, a domestic helper committed suicide [1, 2, 3] at The Interlace Condo.  Subsequently, a few of the residents organized a fundraising campaign [4] for a subsequent donation to her grandparents. Through a reliable source in Singapore, we managed to obtain the bank account [5] of Zin's grandfather, whose name is Daw Thandar Khine. We decided to transfer the total amount collected in parts (rather than a lump sum), with the DBS standing order starting on 15 October 2017 and continuing until 15 January 2026, with transfers every 3 months. Several weeks ago, DBS informed me that the most recent transfer to Ms. Zin's grandparents' bank account was unsuccessful. DBS stated that the reason for the unsuccessful transfer was ""UNABLE TO CONTACT BENEFICIARY PARTY."" I inquired further with the bank, but DBS informed me that they do not have additional information. It is likely that Ms. Zin's grandparents' account is closed, or they may have passed away.  It was subsequently decided that we will donate the remainder of the funds to the following causes, with merits going to Zin and her family: (i) Burmese Buddhist Temple (BBT) (ii) Community Chest of Singapore (CCS) (iii) Paro Centre (sponsored an Amitabha mini statue); Nechu Phu, Paro, Bhutan (iv) 84000: Translating the Words of the Buddha (v) Samaritans of Singapore  This campaign is an extension of 6(v) above.

These are the facts in Singapore: Domestic recycling rates are at an all-time low of 12%, and out of this only 6/10 items in the blue bins are eventually recycled. The rest gets incinerated and sent to our landfill.  And that is not all. Singapore only has one landfill: Semakau. Unfortunately, at the rate we are going, Semakau will be fully filled up by 2035 - about a decade away! We can and must act now so that we and our future generations do not suffer.   Most of us know about recycling, but do we know how to sort recyclables at home and keep them clean until they can be deposited into the correct bins?  Your donation will enable us to impart important knowledge to those who need it, and implement Recycling Hubs around community areas so that you can throw your sorted recyclables in an area you are familiar with.   Imagine this: A community where recycling rates are high because we sort our waste at home, and recycle them at specific bins (eg. plastic, paper, e-waste) that are conveniently located near our homes; resulting is lesser waste pushed to our limited landfill. This is our dream.   Sorting at home has been done in many other countries, it's time we learn how to too, for our future.  We aim to raise $20,000 over the next 6 months to do this.   Donate now and be part of the movement to sort it out and save our only landfill before it is too late.

"1086671","Shine A Light 2024 - No child should face the nightmare of cancer alone.","LOVE, NILS LTD.","When Jacob* was 5 years old, his mother Sophie noticed he seemed unusually tired and had little appetite. Instead of waiting it out, she trusted her mother's intuition and took him to the pediatrician for a checkup.  That decision may have saved Jacob's life.  After running some tests, the doctor discovered a large mass in Jacob's abdomen. He was diagnosed with stage 3 neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer. The family's world was shattered.  Jacob immediately began an aggressive treatment plan of chemotherapy, radiation, stem cell transplant, and surgery to remove the tumor. The road was long and immensely difficult for such a young child, but his family remained hopeful and positive.  Thanks to Sophie's prompt action in getting Jacob checked out at the first signs something was wrong, the cancer was caught relatively early before spreading further. After over a year of grueling treatment, Jacob got the incredible news - he was cancer free.  Now a thriving 9-year-old full of energy and life, Jacob loves playing soccer and video games with his friends. His family is forever grateful they didn't delay when Sophie's instincts told her something wasn't right.  LOVE , NILS' Shine-A-Light campaign spotlights on why raising awareness for the signs of childhood cancer is so crucial. When caught early, many childhood cancers are very treatable but most parents don't know what to look for.  Please give generously and help us shine a light on this important cause. No child should have to face the nightmare of cancer alone. With early detection, we can give them a fighting chance.   *name changed","At LOVE, NILS we provide support to children with cancer and their caregivers with much needed healthcare guidance, emotional care plus social and community support that will enable them to thrive.  THE CHALLENGE Where do you even begin? Parents seeking treatment for their child have to find their way through complex, often puzzling healthcare systems. Both parent and child face immense challenges to their well-being, such as anxiety, isolation and depression. To stand a better fighting chance, families need guidance, emotional care, a strong community and other forms of support that some hospitals may not be able to fully provide.  THE WORK - Holistic support with a difference. LOVE, NILS provides families with knowledge, resources and community support at every step of the way. We co-fund a Hospital Care Coordinator at National University Hospital.  As a patient navigator, she guides patients and caregivers to receive the help they need.      We believe it takes a village to heal a child. And that's why we hold regular toy drives, events, school programs and hospital visits involving many dedicated individuals, to keep children and caregivers socially engaged, hopeful and resilient. This way, they know they're not alone in the fight."

In recognition of Felix's commitment to helping others, the family wanted to find a way to honour him and help to continue to pay it forward. With that intent, the Felix Bell Paediatric Critical Care Programme was founded. Under the auspices of the SingHealth Duke-NUS Paediatrics Academic Clinical Programme, this Fund aims to advance the holistic care of critically ill children.  The multi-disciplinary initiative with an initial focus of this Fund was on the Let’s MoveEM Programme, a multi focus on early mobilisation of critically ill patients to improve their outcomes. Our objectives have since been expanded to include other aspects of care that aim to prevent critical illness related morbidity, improve patient outcomes, and improve the experience of patients and their families. The development of this Fund is now aimed at advancing the holistic care of children and integrating the treatment of their critical illness with therapies and interventions which aim to hasten and optimize every child’s recovery and minimise the consequences on their long-term physical, emotional, cognitive, and psychosocial health.   Since the establishment of the Fund, we have been able to maintain a high rate of mobilisation: more than 80% of ICU patients were mobilised last year, an increase from the year before. We thank the donors who have helped to achieve the initial target of $150,000 to successfully kick-start the Fund. We have come this far due to the generous support of donors like you, who believe in our goals and contribute to this Fund. Your gift will ensure that Felix’s spirit of generosity continues to live on through the children and families in our care.","Because every woman and child deserves good health...

In 2010, I’ve faced the heartbreak of losing my first grandson to a heart problem when he was just 4 years old. During the same year, my husband suffered a stroke, further adding on to my burdens.  Tragically, in 2014, Zurah suffered a stroke, leaving her bedridden and ending her marriage. I left my job as a cleaner to provide full-time care for Zurah and my husband, along with supporting my eldest son who has an intellectual disability. In 2021, we were struck by another devastating loss with the passing of my husband.  In the midst of our struggles, we were fortunate to be connected with HWA by a government agency. Zurah became a beneficiary of HWA’s Personal Home Care Services, which provided essential assistance by sending a healthcare attendant to assist Zurah’s showering care showering thrice weekly. This has been an immense blessing, alleviating some of the burdens I carry.  We know there are many families like us who receive help from HWA. Even though it’s hard, we keep going for our family. HWA’s services not only transformed our lives, but also instilled a sense of hope and resilience through our daily struggles.  HWA’s Flag Day will be held island wide* on 31st August 2024 to raise funds for its programmes and services.

The number of beneficiaries that HWA serves is also growing and this means HWA has to increase its staff strength to meet the needs of the beneficiaries.  With continuing community support, HWA will be empowered to continue its mission of serving people with disabilities and the elderly.

"913148","Specialised Services-Ensure No Child Is Left Behind In Getting Essential Support","Children's Wishing Well","S joined CWW in 2021. Despite his hard work and the multiple tuition and support from CWW, he struggled to do well in school. It was only when our staff arranged for an assessment by an Educational Psychologist that we uncovered the root of his difficulties: marked speech and language challenges.  Beyond his academic struggles, S's self-esteem suffered due to his speech impediment. S was often alone. He was afraid of speaking to others, kept his feelings to himself, and responded with shaking his head. As S presented with both speech and language difficulties, he needed an intensive one-on-one literacy program and weekly speech therapy.  Speech therapy is mostly available in hospital or private learning centres. However, S's family cannot afford it. It would also be a logistical challenge to send and fetch him from the centre, which is far from home. Another option would be group sessions conducted at other learning centres or school. However, with S already lacking behind his peers in school, he needed a more tailored one to one intervention and hence group sessions would not have been enough. This is where CWW stepped in. Over 6 months of literacy intervention and 15 months of speech therapy, S showed remarkable progress. He now confidently engages in conversations, has forged meaningful friendships, and has seen improvements in both his academic performance and self-confidence.  Navigating learning difficulties is challenging, especially for families from lower-income backgrounds like S. CWW's specialised services department plays a vital role in providing essential support, including counselling, educational assessments, psychological interventions, speech therapy, and dyslexia support. These services are often too expensive for families like S's.  Join us in empowering more children like S to thrive and break the cycle of poverty. By donating to this campaign, you support the specialised services department and ensure that no child is denied such key services.

Pets bring joy and companionship, provide comfort and reduce loneliness, especially during periods of stress and adversity. In many cases, pets enhance the emotional and socio-psychological well-being of their owners. Animal & Veterinary Service (AVS), a cluster under National Parks Board, recognises this important role of pets, and the lack of capacity or capability that low-income pet owners may face in caring for their pets.   Your gift to support the Pet Cat Sterilisation Support (PCSS) programme, helps low-income households to sterilise and microchip their pet cats. Sterilisation not only prevents unintended breeding; it also improves the health of cats by reducing the risk of certain cancers, and reduces undesirable behaviours such as caterwauling and roaming. Microchipping enhances traceability, allowing lost cats to be quickly reunited with their owners.   Overall, this programme helps low-income pet owners to better care for their pet cats, which in turn, improves owners’ well-being. PCSS will be provided through two approaches:   1) Quarterly Sterilisation Days, where we target to sterilise and microchip 100 cats per Sterilisation Day; and   2) Sterilisation at PCSS Panel Clinics, at owners’ convenience.   Your donation will support programme management, sterilisation, microchipping and transportation costs. AVS is collaborating with the Cat Welfare Society, Singapore Veterinary Association and Temasek Polytechnic on the PCSS Sterilisation Days.

At Life Community Services Society, our mission is to empower children and families through care and mentoring.      Through no fault of theirs, the children we care for have been put in less-advantaged positions due to their family circumstances. This could include parental incarceration, single-parent families, complicated family situations, or children living in public rental housing.     Every child deserves a fair chance in life to live to their fullest potential. They deserve a chance to have hope and a future.     As we look ahead to the future, we are inspired by the progress we have made and remain steadfast in our mission to create positive change and make a difference in the lives of those we serve.  ""To help them to re-dream, they need someone who believes in them, someone who sees their hidden strengths and provides them with opportunities to groom their talents. Despite their difficult family backgrounds and oftentimes rejection by the society, each one of them deserves the right to be heard, the right to have a voice, the right to receive care, the right to pursue dreams and one day achieve their fullest potential to have a bright future. One day, they may even become the catalyst of hope to carry forward the spirit of mentoring and impact the next generation to come."" - Quote from Ms Geraldine Chew, Social Worker, Life Community Services Society (2020 – Present) ","Annually, Life Community serves over 900 children and families from low-income and/or vulnerable backgrounds, such as parental incarceration, through five core programmes.  Our programmes focus on intervention work, including preventive, remedial and holistic development (character, moral values, social and emotional well-being) to reduce potential problems such as crime, drug abuse and poor academic, physical, social and mental health.  We have seen that challenging family situations such as financial challenges, parental incarceration and neglect, cause much emotional stress, trauma and wounds in their children. When a child experiences such stressors in the long run, their cognitive and emotional development are hindered.   They find it harder to develop essential traits such as resilience and grit, which are crucial to help them break out of their circumstances. This also sets them back earlier on in life.  Life Community intervenes to close these gaps, so no child or youth is left behind.   We aim to help them build strong foundations in their growing years and to reach their fullest potential, with resilience and purpose, later in life."

Seeing the plight of the local women and children of that time and the lack of medical services for them, Dr. Ferguson-Davie set up a dispensary along Bencoolen Street for the destitute women and children. The Medical Mission continued to meet the locals' needs and thus led to the opening of more dispensaries and eventually, St. Andrew's Mission Hospital in 1923 and St. Andrew's Orthopaedic Hospital in 1939.

"461907","Support the Paediatric Bowel and Bladder Programme Fund – Improving Care Via Training and Education","KKH Health Fund","Most parents remember their child's first year in terms of their developmental milestones: first smile; first solid food; first word or first step. We remember J's first year by his surgeries: stoma creation on day 2, anus creation at 10 weeks, stoma closure at 5 months.   J was born with imperforate anus and needed several surgeries as a baby for the best chance at normal continence. After several years of soiling, constipation, severe diaper rash and performing daily rectal washouts, we were connected, by God’s grace and timing, with a leading surgeon from the US. Amid the pandemic, we brought J to the US for a major surgery when he was 5 years old. The post-operative recovery was immensely challenging as it involved caring for a difficult surgical wound at the anus, learning to do bowel flushes via a tube inserted into his belly button, more consecutive day surgeries to manage his post-operative complications, and daily rectal dilatations. It was only 15 months after his final surgery that J was ready for a trial to switch to oral laxatives.   Now aged 8, J is in a significantly better place. He needs extremely high doses of oral laxatives daily and what most of us take for granted will likely remain a challenge for him, but he has been a real trooper all these years – always smiley, enthusiastic, and never complaining. He has shown us what resilience looks like in the face of unmistakable adversity.  We have been impelled by J's fight to start the Paediatric Bowel and Bladder Programme Fund, which will provide opportunities for the team to undergo specialised training in this uncommon bowel condition, enable learning from foreign experts on cases and treatment programmes for the local setting, establish support groups for families with similar medical needs and create a greater awareness of this somewhat invisible condition.  This fund represents a collective dream that more children with medical conditions similar to J will be able to live life to the fullest. ","Because every woman and child deserves good health...

Seeing the plight of the local women and children of that time and the lack of medical services for them, Dr. Ferguson-Davie set up a dispensary along Bencoolen Street for the destitute women and children. The Medical Mission continued to meet the locals' needs and thus led to the opening of more dispensaries and eventually, St. Andrew's Mission Hospital in 1923 and St. Andrew's Orthopaedic Hospital in 1939.

In a society where education serves as a gateway to one's future and success, it's important to recognise that the educational path varies for everyone.

Recognising the need for continued support and training, Germaine’s mother re-enrolled Germaine at the APSN Centre for Adults in 2021.  During her training, Germaine’s mood fluctuations often affected her work tasks. She was also easily distracted by others and became temperamental whenever there were changes in routine. To aid Germaine, her form instructor, Max Liong, designed a personalised checklist and set goals to help her improve on her ability to focus, work well with others, adapt to changes in routine and be more receptive to feedback.   Through continuous guidance and with the support of her peers, Germaine is now able to manage distractions, cope well with her work tasks and has better relationships with her peers. To further support her needs, we also provide financial aid through our financial assistance scheme to cover her training fees and insurance, and also provide transport and meal allowances.  Germaine’s mother has also noticed the significant improvements in her daughter.

As ICU care improves, severely ill children are more likely to survive their critical illnesses, but these survivors may develop problems with physical, emotional, cognitive and social functions, which may take months or years to recover. The family unit is also often significantly affected by a child’s illness and needs support during admission and after discharge from hospital.   Let’s MoveEM! focuses on interventions to promote recovery while minimising the inevitable complications of the severe illnesses and the corresponding treatments. Some examples include optimising comfort and sleep, promoting physical mobility even when critically ill, and family-centred initiatives to reduce patient and family stress during the ICU stay. These interventions improve our patients’ recovery from critical illnesses, improve their functional status, reduce the duration of their hospital stay and improve theirs and their families’ experience in the CICU in the months ahead.   To raise funds for our patients and their families, the CICU team will run a collective distance of 170km over 6 months to raise $17,000. All funds raised through this campaign will go towards the Felix Bell Paediatric Critical Care Programme Fund.

As a coaching organization, we have witnessed how lives have changed and its ripple effects in individuals from a single coaching session. As such, in 2024, we are inspired to introduce the beauty of coaching to the general public and for them to experience how magical and transformative coaching is, through providing pro-bono coaching sessions to the public. In return, the coachees who have benefited from our coaching sessions would donate a sum to Caregiving Welfare Association (CWA).   The target amount would be at S$10,000 or more from now to 31st December 2024. Aside from pro bono coaching through the workshops we have organized so far, there will be a series of other activities planned out in the year to gather more coachees to coach within the coaching community in Singapore so that these proceeds can go to CWA.   Why CWA?   ECI has shortlisted CWA because we would like to bring more light and exposure to the challenges that caregivers face, especially in face of the aging population in Singapore. Many times, the needs and the support of these caregivers are often neglected because they play a supporting role, secondary to the elderly who may require more help and support.   Through this campaign, as much as we want to bring coaching to the world, we would also want to bring CWA along on this journey to highlight the needs of caregivers and the elderly to the people in Singapore, so that more contribution and support can be given to these often overlooked groups of individuals.

These lessons are paid for by donors and CWW does not take any cut from it.  XY (Pictured above) is a chatty and outgoing girl. She uses art to express herself and has great interest especially in drawing anime characters. At the centre, she often asks if she can have colouring paper with anime to keep herself engaged.   Through her Fine Art lessons (sponsored under the Reach For The Stars programme), she has grown in her talent, exploring various mediums and types of art.  “I learned many new skills such as sketching and painting. The sketching skills I learned have come in handy when doing my art drawings and allowed me to draw even better.”  Beyond just her art skills, enrichment lessons such as these, teach our young ones invaluable lessons and builds their character. In her own words: “This course has taught me patience during my activities. Previously, I would give up and stop midway through my drawings as I lost patience. However, after the art classes, I am much more patient and can finish all my pictures in one sitting without taking regular breaks.”  She looks forward to applying for Direct School Admission (DSA) with the portfolio she has built and we are excited to see her talent grow!

Seeing the plight of the local women and children of that time and the lack of medical services for them, Dr. Ferguson-Davie set up a dispensary along Bencoolen Street for the destitute women and children. The Medical Mission continued to meet the locals' needs and thus led to the opening of more dispensaries and eventually, St. Andrew's Mission Hospital in 1923 and St. Andrew's Orthopaedic Hospital in 1939.  Working closely with the Government, SAMH constantly developed its services to meet the relevant needs of our local community at all times.

This can keep them stuck in the poverty trap, without the right support for training and upskilling.   At Children’s Wishing Well, our goal is to empower parents through relevant, certified courses offered by accredited service providers. This training equips them with valuable skills, making them more employable and offering a pathway out of the poverty trap by securing stable, higher-paying jobs.  Mr M (pictured above) is testimony to the impact that such upskilling programmes can have.   After having done his research, Mr M found out that there are companies out there which are willing to hire ex-offenders as dispatch drivers and pay them full time salaries with CPF benefits. CWW hence sponsored his Class 3 Driver's Licence and armed with this licence, he is now a temporary dispatch driver.   He now aims to gain as much as experience as he can by clocking more hours on the road so that he can increase his chances of eventually securing a full-time job.

At BMSG, we firmly believe that every individual should have the opportunity to learn, practice, and receive the support they need to feel comfortable and confident in their breastfeeding journey.  Motherhood is a challenging path, requiring mothers to invest tremendous effort in ensuring the safety, nourishment, and love of their children. For many mothers, breastfeeding is a fundamental way to fulfill these responsibilities.  The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a child's life, followed by the introduction of nutritious complementary foods for at least two years and beyond.  Our free breastfeeding workshops have already made a meaningful impact on previous CHAS card-holding participants, enabling them to make informed choices about feeding their infants.  You too have the opportunity to sponsor a breastfeeding mother (who holds a valid CHAS card) and a family member, ensuring they have access to crucial breastfeeding education and support. With your support, we aim to provide free breastfeeding workshops to 80 mothers from low-income households.  The annual cost of operating BMSG is approximately $100,000, which covers expenses such as staffing, public workshops, counselor training, and counseling services. BMSG relies on your generous donations to continue its vital work, and unfortunately, our funds are currently running low.

Most colorectal cancers start as benign (non-cancerous) growths known as polyps where they do not display any symptoms. If left undetected, polyps can develop into colorectal cancer. Many patients who present with symptoms from cancer are already at late stage.    Prevention is better than cure. And colonoscopy is the gold standard procedure to identify and remove polyps before they have the chance to turn cancerous. Colonoscopy can also detect early cancer which leads to a much higher chance of cure and survival.    Many people are hesitant to undergo colonoscopy due to financial concerns.

Noah's Ark Companion Animal Rescue & Education Society (Noah's Ark CARES) requires approximately $20 000 monthly for vet costs for injured and/or sick dogs, and 1 250+ kilograms of dry food for the Jurong Island project, among other required expenses (reference from https://www.noahsarkcares.com/).  Woofy says 'Thank You' for helping his fellow friends!","NA CARES was registered in 2005 to undertake sterilization projects of both stray dogs and cats in Singapore, rehome adoptable strays, and to ensure the welfare of animals sent to Noahs Ark Natural Animal Sanctuary (NANAS) by assisting in the fund raising efforts for NANAS in Malaysia. Since then, NA CARES has sterilized an average of 150 animals each year in Singapore, through the dedicated hard work of its Singapore volunteers and vets.  In 2015, NA CARES was asked to participate in the Trap-Neuter-Relocate project in Jurong Island, together with ASD and SOSD. In recognition of our efforts, MCCY granted NA CARES charity status on 9.5.2016. With conferment of charitable status comes greater regulation and requirements imposed on NA CARES, and we have been asked to separate the Singapore from the Malaysian activities.  NA CARES has been re-organised to reflect its Singapore-centric activities. A new logo has been introduced so that supporters are aware that NA CARES is no longer involved with any of the Malaysian activities of NANAS."

It is also the number one cause of cancer death in women. Identifying those most at risk helps in the fight against the disease.  An innovative study, led by Professor Ann Lee, has successfully identified variations in some of the genes associated with breast cancer. Looking at women with early-onset or a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, Researchers compared DNA sequences and discovered several variants that are significantly associated with breast cancer risk.  Such variants may be used for determining the risk of breast cancer and could improve cancer screening in the future. The team aims to identify additional variants associated with breast cancer, through this next-generation sequencing process.  Funding is urgently needed to continue with this essential area of research.

"1188165","Wheels for Ren Ci Hospital","Ren Ci Hospital","Since its founding in 1994, Ren Ci has grown from a small Chronic Sick Ward based in Buangkok to today where we operate out of four locations with a spectrum of services ranging from Community Hospital, Nursing Homes, Senior Care Centres, Active Ageing Centre (Care) and Home Care. In 2023 alone, we served more than 3,000 beneficiaries. Most of Ren Ci's patients suffer from multiple medical conditions and more than 80% are from low-income families with per capita family income less than $1,200.   Our third nursing home in Woodlands has turned operational in February 2024 and it houses more than 300 nursing home beds, a senior care centre for 100 clients, and a home care team serving 100 clients.  Transport costs for wheelchair-bound residents have been rising, and are expected to increase further in view of the current economic climate. Your donation to this campaign will help to alleviate the costs involved in providing much-needed mobility and accessibility to our residents, who require wheelchair transport to get to places they need to be, whether it's medical checkups at the polyclinic or dialysis at the dialysis centre.  To serve more patients and clients who are wheelchair bound from the low-income families, we sincerely appeal for you to support this meaningful cause. With your help, we hope to raise enough funds to purchase one more wheelchair transport vehicle.  Thank you and we wish you good health, success and best wishes always.","The roots of Ren Ci traced back to 1994 with the primary mission of providing affordable medical, nursing and rehabilitative care services for the community, living to its name of ""compassion"" and ""benevolence"". This is driven by the principle of serving all with loving kindness and compassion, regardless of background, race and religion.  Most of the long-staying residents in our nursing homes come from low income families, while some are destitute. Suffering from multiple chronic medical conditions, their long-term healthcare needs have been draining them financially. While majority of the patients are either wheelchair bound or bedridden, they still long to return to their loved ones someday."
