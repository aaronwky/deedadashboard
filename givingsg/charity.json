We are an independently administered charity with a simple mission - to directly improve the health and well-being of children in Singapore.\n\nWe believe that a \"home\" is more than four walls and a roof over your head. That is why every Ronald McDonald House is a safe haven that provides all the comforts of home, plus the compassion and hospitality of staff, volunteers, and other families - all just steps away from the hospital.\n\nOur home is filled with more than help; it is filled with hope. We believe that when families are together, they cope better. That is because we believe that no family should have to deal with their child's medical crisis alone.\n\nSeriously ill or injured children often need to spend weeks or months in a hospital for the necessary treatment. It is not only an incredibly long time to be away from home but also for a family to be divided - usually with the mother at the bedside of the sick child, leaving the father or relatives to take care of the siblings. Ronald McDonald House serves as a place of respite and also one for the families to gather, while being close to their warded child.\n\nFor our Data Protection Notice, please visit https://rmhc.sg/dataprotection/",

Seeing the plight of the local women and children of that time and the lack of medical services for them, Dr. Ferguson-Davie set up a dispensary along Bencoolen Street for the destitute women and children. The Medical Mission continued to meet the locals' needs and thus led to the opening of more dispensaries and eventually, St. Andrew's Mission Hospital in 1923 and St. Andrew's Orthopaedic Hospital in 1939.\n\nWorking closely with the Government, SAMH constantly developed its services to meet the relevant needs of our local community at all times. Today, SAMH has under its operation: St. Andrew's Autism Centre, St. Andrew's Community Hospital, St. Andrew's Nursing Home, St. Andrew's Senior Care, St. Andrew's Migrant Worker Medical Centre, St. Andrew's Mission School and St. Andrew's Mission Hospital Clinic.",

We support our member organisations in their work, and we create opportunities for discussion and debate, for collaboration and cooperation.\n \nWe believe women and men have equal roles to play in the home, at the workplace, in the community, and in leadership.   \n \nIn the last 40 years, the status of women in Singapore has advanced tremendously. But there is still a gender gap. \n \nWomen continue to shoulder the bulk of caregiving work. We face discrimination, harassment, and unequal pay and opportunities at the workplace. And violence in all its forms continues to be the daily reality for far too many women.\n \nTogether with our member organisations, we aim to reduce and ultimately eliminate these inequalities. Our vision, and our mission, is: Equal Space. Equal Voice. Equal Worth.",

Access to affordable healthcare can be a problem for low wage migrant workers as foreigners in Singapore do not receive subsidies for healthcare at public institutions. By law, workers are supposed to be covered for both inpatient and outpatient treatment by their employers but not all do. In addition, fear of repatriation and cultural and language barriers also contribute to migrant workers not receiving proper treatment.\n\nThe more unfortunate amongst these workers get injured at work and may end up losing their jobs and suffering loss of pay for a protracted period. The wait for their work injury compensation application to be processed and resolved can take months or years.\n\nFrom a single clinic providing GP services in Geylang to meet the needs of the workers, HealthServe has expanded our range of services to the provision of GP and specialist medical services, rehabilitation and dental services, injury and salary-related casework support, social assistance, counselling and mental health programmes.\n\nWe are very much a volunteer-run organisation. Our operations are run by a small staff team and hundreds of medical and non-medical volunteers and interns.\n\nHealthServe is honoured to receive the Charity Transparency Award 2023.",

Out of this, it is estimated 50,000 residents are suffering from blindness or vision loss. But only 5% out of 300,000 are gainfully employed. In addition, with the prevalence of diabetes, myopia and the ageing population, there is an increasing number of people with vision loss who need our services.\n\nAt Guide Dogs Singapore Ltd (GDS), we believe that people with visually impairment should not be limited by their disability. We aim to enhance the quality of life for people with vision loss through a range of rehabilitation programmes. Since our inception in 2006, our services have grown beyond providing guide dogs to include teaching people with vision loss the skills needed to live independently and working with community stakeholders to build a supportive society for the vision impaired. To date, we have successfully trained and paired 13 guide dog teams in our history, of which 8 are currently active. \n\nWe operate with limited resources and are grateful for your gifts. Please donate generously to enable us to continue our services and provide more guide dogs to people with visual impairment. All direct donations of a minimum of S$20 are eligible for a 250% tax exemption.\n\nAuto-monthly donations are now available.

It is disheartening that ex-offenders have to live with the stigma of having served time behind bars when they are released from prison, one that can often be more punishing than the prison sentence itself. Many ex-offenders, once released, find themselves literally stepping into a second prison. This time it would be a prison with invisible bars, of suspicion, of mistrust and of discrimination.The best rehabilitation regime during incarceration is of no use if ex-offenders find themselves rejected at every turn when they are released into the larger community.Your generous donation to the Yellow Ribbon Fund will go a long way to help us fund rehabilitative and aftercare programmes, which are the supporting mechanisms to facilitate the reintegration of an individual back to the community and his family.",

As a charity organisation, we provide support for children from low-income families and/or children with Special Needs/ Disabilities. Such charity needs support from individuals and communities so that these children can have a strong foundation.\n\nOther than preparing our children to be ready for school, we believe it is more important that we prepare them for the rest of the years ahead of them. We hope to achieve this by giving each child a Strong Foundation in Truth, Beauty and Goodness. Holding onto these foundational virtues is so important in today's world where truth is distorted, beauty corrupted and goodness disregarded. These virtues will form the cornerstone of our children's being, guiding them to see, understand and act correctly.\n\nTo support the children who comes through our doors, PPS endeavours to support children lower income families and/or children with additional needs support in these 2 areas: Little Blessings for Little Ones and Good Start SG. \n\n*Starting from 2024 16 preschools are operated under our preschool brand, Little Olive Tree.

Since then, NA CARES has sterilized an average of 150 animals each year in Singapore, through the dedicated hard work of its Singapore volunteers and vets.\n\nIn 2015, NA CARES was asked to participate in the Trap-Neuter-Relocate project in Jurong Island, together with ASD and SOSD. In recognition of our efforts, MCCY granted NA CARES charity status on 9.5.2016. With conferment of charitable status comes greater regulation and requirements imposed on NA CARES, and we have been asked to separate the Singapore from the Malaysian activities.\n\nNA CARES has been re-organised to reflect its Singapore-centric activities. A new logo has been introduced so that supporters are aware that NA CARES is no longer involved with any of the Malaysian activities of NANAS.",

Through this, ITI aims to train socially engaged artists who will contribute meaningfully to their cultures and communities, at the same time are capable of working across cultural, linguistic, social and national boundaries.\n \nThe institute is a registered charity and an Institution of Public Character, and more than 60% of its income has to come from fundraising.

        "AboutEntityGroup": "Siong Leng is a non-profit arts organisation that was established in 1941 and aims to preserve, promote and develop Nanyin, an ancient musical artform that dates back to the Han Dynasty. Like many traditional arts in their search for new audiences, there is a call not only for the preservation of Nanyin but also its revitalisation through the infusion of new creative ideas.\n\nToday, Siong Leng has toured and performed in many countries such as France, United States of America, England, Korea, China, Japan and Vietnam. This could not have been possible without the nurturing of young Nanyin practitioners, to give new life to this ancient art form. To carry on with the company's mission, Siong Leng has also experimented with contemporary Nanyin by blending different genres and art forms to create our very own 'Singapore Nanyin'.\n\nSiong Leng owes much of its success to its late chairman, Mr. Teng Mah Seng, a recipient of the Cultural Medallion in 1987. With his dedication to Nanyin, he revitalised the artform by writing new lyrics and music that were livelier and more relatable. \n\nInspired by Mr. Teng's passion and philosophy, Siong Leng has since been awarded 'The Stewards of Intangible Cultural Heritage Award' in 2021.

The early 1950s marked the genesis of SACS, with the setting up of a clinic by Mrs. Francis Thomas, a nurse and the wife of the Principal of St. Andrew's School. The clinic was to serve villagers living in the Potong Pasir area. \n\nIn 1967, the Anglican Welfare Council - renamed Singapore Anglican Welfare Council (SAWC) in 1977 - was inaugurated to serve the needs of the community. SAWC was restructured to bring together the other community service arm of the Anglican Church in Singapore, and was renamed Singapore Anglican Community Services (SACS) in 2004.\n\nPresently, SACS is a voluntary welfare organisation and an approved Institution of Public Character. SACS serves the community through our care services in three areas: Psychiatric Services, Senior Services as well as Family and Children Services.",

The silence around the issue of toilets and sanitation has deadly consequences.  Diarrhoeal diseases - a direct consequence of poor sanitation - kill more children every year than AIDS, malaria, and measles combined. Nearly 1,400 children died per day in 2015 from diarrhoeal diseases due to poor sanitation.\n\nWho are at risk?\n\n2.3 billion people live without access to proper toilets and sanitation. Almost a billion people are forced to pee or poo in the open, i.e. open defecation with disregard to their personal privacy and dignity. This is especially dangerous for women and young girls who are made more vulnerable as a result.\n\nWhat is our goal?\n\nTo end open defecation worldwide by 2030 in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations.

        "AboutEntityGroup": "New Redeemer's Fellowship Society aims to touch the lives of prison inmates, ex-inmates and their families with the love of God. In August 2004, God revealed to a group of Christian brothers the need to reach out and care for the lost in prisons, the ex-inmates and their families. With obedient hearts, they responded to God's calling and started ministering in prisons through preaching the Gospel of Christ, teaching the Word of God and counselling the inmates. God Almighty and His gift of redemption found in the Gospel was displayed through the transformation of many lives in the prisons. ALL GLORY BE TO GOD! However, God's infinite wisdom and plan did not stop there. He guided and led Reverend Ngan Hock Cheng out of the prison in-care ministry in year 2007 and revealed to him and a group of Christian brothers a greater need to set up an after-care ministry. Thus, with the grace of God, New Redeemer's Fellowship Society was formed in 2007 and has since served those seeking to continue their pursuit for God's Heart and Will after being released. As family ministry forms a core in after-care, we have seen God's reconciling love when family ties are formed and strengthened from their united belief in God's everlasting providence and love. We believe that with God's favor, this ministry will continue to serve His Will and Plan for those who are lost.",

We have commissioned over thirty works to date, including a number by Singaporean composers. \n\nAs we continue to explore the musical boundaries of what \"choir music\" is, what singing together means, we hope to showcase what a choir as a means of musical expression can be, and to inspire the proliferation of local choral works, choirs and choristers.",

        "AboutEntityGroup": "Siong Leng is a non-profit arts organisation that was established in 1941 and aims to preserve, promote and develop Nanyin, an ancient musical artform that dates back to the Han Dynasty. Like many traditional arts in their search for new audiences, there is a call not only for the preservation of Nanyin but also its revitalisation through the infusion of new creative ideas.\n\nToday, Siong Leng has toured and performed in many countries such as France, United States of America, England, Korea, China, Japan and Vietnam. This could not have been possible without the nurturing of young Nanyin practitioners, to give new life to this ancient art form. To carry on with the company's mission, Siong Leng has also experimented with contemporary Nanyin by blending different genres and art forms to create our very own 'Singapore Nanyin'.\n\nSiong Leng owes much of its success to its late chairman, Mr. Teng Mah Seng, a recipient of the Cultural Medallion in 1987. With his dedication to Nanyin, he revitalised the artform by writing new lyrics and music that were livelier and more relatable. \n\nInspired by Mr. Teng's passion and philosophy, Siong Leng has since been awarded 'The Stewards of Intangible Cultural Heritage Award' in 2021. And in 2017, Siong Leng was the recipient of the inaugural 'Singapore Chinese Cultural Contribution Award'. Siong Leng is also a recipient of the National Arts Council's Major Grant and has achieved the status as an Institution of a Public Character (IPC).",

Giving to arts and cultural heritage often suffer a setback despite the fact that this work needs to be continued, and in some instances, is becoming more important to provide respite from our highly digital-led world.

Through training rooted in classical Odissi and artistic productions with a process-oriented, research-based approach, Chowk's mission is to develop, from our Singapore base, an Asian contemporary dance expression that dissolves the dichotomy between tradition and modernity.\n\nUsing Odissi as a base for training dancers and students, Maitra has developed a distinct aesthetic of her own by creating a style of dance informed by Eastern aesthetics. Blurring the lines between the classical and contemporary, Chowk's productions investigate the different possibilities and vocabularies that are unique to the world of contemporary dance by drawing from the classical.\n\nDespite being a small company, Chowk has played an important role in the development of Singapore's transcultural work by representing Singapore on the international stage, growing a tight-knit community of artists and non-artists alike, and creating countless opportunities for young artists.\n\nChowk needs your support now. The financial impact of COVID-19 has hit us hard as most of our funding comes from commissions and live performances. Your donations will be a vital source of support and enable Chowk to continue making a difference with our unique work.",

This leads to struggles to cope with life's stressors in ways that are harmful and detrimental to themselves and their families. These may manifest itself in dysfunctional families, abuse, pornography, radicalisation and aggression. This may be even more accentuated amongst vulnerable men i.e. those who face multiple stressors and, or recipients of social service interventions.\n\nIn Singapore, little research exists to uncover how men see themselves. There is even lesser understanding of how men could be supported. We believe helping men go beyond fulfilling their basic financial and economic needs. There is more work to be done.  \n\nThrough our philosophy of developing Resilience, Integrity, Strength and Energy in men, we build scaffolds to allow the men to climb toward their aspirations, while working with other social service partners to meet their basic needs.\n\nWe envision a community of transformed men who are role models of healthy masculinity and socio-emotional-physical wellbeing.",

About 90 percent of stroke patients survive and carry on living for many years. However, most experience physical, cognitive, and psychosocial deficits that may impact their quality of life. Their caregivers also shoulder the responsibility of looking after stroke survivors, often neglecting their own well-being. Adding to this, the financial costs of rehabilitation and recovery may also pose a significant stressor for them. Your generous donations to S3 will go a long way towards helping stroke survivors and their caregivers in the journey of recovery and care.\n\nWith S3, post-discharge survivors of stroke are able to receive care continuum through rehabilitation that integrates advanced assistive technologies with conventional therapy as well as our signature S3 Wellness programme supporting cognitive and psychosocial development in order to maximise recovery potential, independence and reintegration.\n\nS3 also works with partners to rally stroke survivors, their families, volunteers and partners to raise awareness of stroke prevention in the wider community.",

A disability is just a functional limitation whether it is physical, mental and visual. Lawn bowling is one of the few sports where anyone can participate and enjoy the activity regardless of any disabilities or ages. The game improves fitness, develops new skills, increases social contacts and helps in enjoying the challenges of competitions. Above all, the game gives an intellectual stimulation and it is an ideal sport for Singapore where there is a fast growing number of senior citizens.",

Through training rooted in classical Odissi and artistic productions with a process-oriented, research-based approach, Chowk's mission is to develop, from our Singapore base, an Asian contemporary dance expression that dissolves the dichotomy between tradition and modernity.\n\nUsing Odissi as a base for training dancers and students, Maitra has developed a distinct aesthetic of her own by creating a style of dance informed by Eastern aesthetics. Blurring the lines between the classical and contemporary, Chowk's productions investigate the different possibilities and vocabularies that are unique to the world of contemporary dance by drawing from the classical.\n\nDespite being a small company, Chowk has played an important role in the development of Singapore's transcultural work by representing Singapore on the international stage, growing a tight-knit community of artists and non-artists alike, and creating countless opportunities for young artists.\n\nChowk needs your support now. The financial impact of COVID-19 has hit us hard as most of our funding comes from commissions and live performances. Your donations will be a vital source of support and enable Chowk to continue making a difference with our unique work.",
